<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I
<br />A NEW CRAFT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Carefully! O, do be careful, Ethel
Brown! I&rsquo;m so afraid I&rsquo;ll drop one of
them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Ethel Blue Morton speaking to her cousin,
who was helping her and their other cousin, Dorothy
Smith, take Dicky Morton&rsquo;s newly hatched chickens
out of the incubator and put them into the brooder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>have</i> dropped one,&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy.
&ldquo;Poor little dinky thing! It didn&rsquo;t hurt it a bit,
though. See, it&rsquo;s running about as chipper as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you counting &rsquo;em?&rdquo; demanded Dicky,
whose small hands were better suited than those of
the girls for making the transfer that was to establish
the chicks in their new habitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered all three in chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one with a twisted leg. He must have
fallen off the tray when he was first hatched.&rdquo; cried
Ethel Brown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He lookth pretty well. I gueth he&rsquo;ll live if I
feed him by himthelf tho the throng ones won&rsquo;t
crowd him away from the feed panth,&rdquo; said Dicky,
examining the cripple, for in spite of his small supply
of seven years he had learned from his big
brother Roger and from his grandfather Emerson
a great deal about the use of an incubator and the
care of young chickens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good hatch for this time of year,&rdquo;
Ethel Brown announced when she added together
the numbers which each handler reported to her.
&ldquo;A hundred and thirty-seven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear their little beaks tapping the wooden
floor,&rdquo; Ethel Blue said, calling their attention to
the behavior of the just-installed little fowls who
were making themselves entirely at home with extraordinary
promptness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They take naturally to oatmeal flakes, don&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; commented Dorothy. &ldquo;I always thought
the old hen taught the chicks to scratch, and there&rsquo;s
a little chap scratching as vigorously as if he had
been taking lessons ever since he was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t need lessons. Scratching is as natural
as eating to them. Hear them hum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all listened, smiling at the note of contentment
that buzzed gently from the greedy groups of
crowding chicks. As the oatmeal disappeared the
chickens looked about them for shelter and discovered
the strips of cloth that did duty for the maternal
wings. Rushing beneath them they cuddled
side by side in the covered part of the brooder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that one tucking his head under his
wing like a grown-up hen!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to turn the lamp up a little higher tho
they won&rsquo;t crowd and hurt each other,&rdquo; Dicky decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d wait a minute until they begin to warm the
whole of their house by the warmth from their bodies,&rdquo;
urged Ethel Brown, and her brother agreed
that there was no need of haste, but he watched
them closely until he saw that they were not trampling
on each other&rsquo;s backs or sitting down hard on
each other&rsquo;s heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will they come out again?&rdquo; asked Dorothy,
who had never seen an incubator and brooder
in operation before and who was immensely interested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they are hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How soon will that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In about two hours. They&rsquo;re a good deal like
babies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is this brooder a really good step-mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a foster-mother,&rdquo; corrected Ethel Blue.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t anything so horrid as a step-mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t think step-mothers are horrid,&rdquo; objected
Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeth, they are,&rdquo; insisted Dicky. &ldquo;All the fairy
stories say they&rsquo;re cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, fairy stories,&rdquo; sniffed Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine fairy stories are right about step-mothers,&rdquo;
insisted Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know one?&rdquo; asked Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never did; but I have a feeling that
they couldn&rsquo;t love a child that wasn&rsquo;t their own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Ethel Brown. &ldquo;Mother
loves you just as well as she does her own children
and you&rsquo;re only her niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not her own niece, either&mdash;Uncle Roger&rsquo;s
niece,&rdquo; corrected Ethel Blue; &ldquo;but then, Aunt
Marion is a darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why a step-mother shouldn&rsquo;t be a
darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why she shouldn&rsquo;t be but I don&rsquo;t believe
she ever is,&rdquo; and Ethel Blue stuck to her opinion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there aren&rsquo;t any &lsquo;steps&rsquo; around this family,
so we can&rsquo;t tell by our own experience,&rdquo; cried
Dorothy, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ve got this chicken family moved
into its new house, so let&rsquo;s go and see what the
workmen are doing at our new house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy&rsquo;s mother had been planning for several
months to build a house on a lot of land on the same
street that they were living on now, but farther
away from the Mortons&rsquo; and nearer the farm where
lived the Mortons&rsquo; grandfather and grandmother,
Mr. and Mrs. Emerson. The contractor had been
at work only a few days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had just finished staking off the ground when
I was there the other afternoon,&rdquo; said Ethel Brown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s way ahead of that now,&rdquo; Dorothy reported
as they walked on, three abreast across the sidewalk,
their blue serge suits all alike, their Tipperary hats
set at the same angle on their heads, and only the
different colors of their eyes and hair distinguishing
them to a careless observer. &ldquo;He told me yesterday
that the whole cellar would be dug by this afternoon
and they would be beginning to put in the concrete
wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cellar wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought cellar walls were made of stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes they are, but when there isn&rsquo;t stone
all cut, concrete is more convenient and cheaper,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it lasts forever, I was reading the other
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it did. Those old Pyramids in
Egypt are partly made of concrete, they think, and
they are three or four thousand years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Aunt Louise expect her house to last three
or four thousand years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants it durable; and fireproof, any way,
because we&rsquo;re some distance from the engine house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we watch this house grow it will be almost
like building it with our own hands, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; exclaimed
Ethel Brown, for, although the house was
her aunt&rsquo;s, Mrs. Smith had made all the cousins
feel that she wanted them to have a share in the
pleasure that she and Dorothy were having in making
a shelter for themselves after their many years
of wandering. She and her daughter consulted over
every part of the plans and they had often asked the
opinion of the Mortons, so that they all had come
to say &ldquo;our house&rdquo; quite as if it were to belong to
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>As they approached the knoll which they had been
calling &ldquo;our house lot&rdquo; for several months, they
saw that the gravel for the concrete was being hauled
to the top of the hill where the bags of sand and
cement had already been unloaded and a small concrete
mixer set up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do things fast, don&rsquo;t they!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dorothy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s Mr. Anderson, the contractor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tall, substantial Scotsman bowed to them as
they reached the top of the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you come to superintend us, Miss Dorothy?&rdquo;
he asked pleasantly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to
make all our preparations for mixing the concrete
to-day, and then we&rsquo;ll start up the machine to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t have the cellar wall all built by to-morrow
after school, will you?&rdquo; asked Dorothy
anxiously. &ldquo;We want to see how you do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t take long to do this small cellar so
you&rsquo;d better hurry right here from your luncheon,&rdquo;
Mr. Anderson returned as he walked away to attend
to the placing of the pile of gravel, and to lay a
friendly hand on the sides of the panting horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your driveway doesn&rsquo;t wind around more
than this road that the hauling men have made all
your friends&rsquo; horses will be puffing like mills when
they reach the top,&rdquo; Ethel Blue warned her cousin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mother and the architect and a landscape gardener
have it all drawn on paper,&rdquo; Dorothy responded.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to sweep around the foot of
the knoll and come gently up the side and lie quite flat
on top of the ridge for a little way before it reaches
the front door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be a long walk for people on foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethel Blue is speaking for herself,&rdquo; laughed
Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for Dorothy, too. She&rsquo;ll walk most of the
time even if Aunt Louise is going to set up a car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s to be a footpath over there,&rdquo; Dorothy
indicated a side of the hill away from the proposed
driveway. &ldquo;It will be a short cut and it&rsquo;s
going to be walled in with shrubs so it won&rsquo;t be seen
from the driveway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would be the harm if you could see it
from the driveway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, the lines would interfere, the landscape artist
said. You mustn&rsquo;t have things confused, you
know,&rdquo; and she shook her head as if she knew a
great deal about the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it would look all mixy and queer if
you should see the grounds from an airship,&rdquo; guessed
Ethel Brown, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see what difference it
would make from the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it would be ugly or he wouldn&rsquo;t be so
particular about it,&rdquo; insisted Dorothy. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s his
business&mdash;to make grounds look lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can see what he means,&rdquo; ventured
Ethel Blue, who knew something about drawing and
design. &ldquo;I watched Aunt Marion&rsquo;s dressmaker
draping an evening gown for her one day. She
made certain lines straight and other lines curved,
but the two kinds of lines didn&rsquo;t cross each other
any old way; she put them in certain places so that
they would each make the other kind of line look
better and not make the general effect confusing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember how it was when we were
planning Dorothy&rsquo;s garden on top of this ridge, back
of the house and the garage?&rdquo; Ethel Brown reminded
them. &ldquo;We had to draw several positions
for the different beds because some of our plans
looked perfectly crazy&mdash;just a mess of square beds
and oblong beds and round beds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They made you dizzy&mdash;I remember. We
found we had to follow Roger&rsquo;s advice and make
them balance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helen says there&rsquo;s a lot of geometry in laying
out a garden. I guess she&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen and Roger were Ethel Brown&rsquo;s older sister
and brother. They were in the high school.</p>
<p>They had come now to the excavation for the
cellar and watched the Italian laborers throwing out
the last shovelfuls of earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very particular about making the earth
wall smooth,&rdquo; commented Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine they have to if the wall is to be concrete,&rdquo;
returned Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve cut it under queerly at the foot on both
sides; what&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the dimmest,&rdquo; answered Dorothy
briefly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask Mr. Anderson.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d find it hard to stand up straight if you
had only a leg to stand on and not a foot,&rdquo; that gentleman
answered to the question. &ldquo;That concrete
foot gives a good solid foundation, and it helps to
repel the frost if that should get into the ground so
deep. Do you see the planks the men are setting up
twelve inches in from the bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are making a fence all around the cellar
you see; that is to keep the concrete in place when
it is poured in, and to give it shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it soft like mud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is made of one part of cement and two and
one-half parts of sand and five parts of gravel. Do
you cook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you come to-morrow you&rsquo;ll see the mixing
machine making a stiff batter of those three
things&mdash;cement and sand and gravel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be like putting raisins in a plum pudding,&rdquo;
suggested Ethel Brown. &ldquo;You have to be
careful the stones&mdash;the raisins&mdash;don&rsquo;t all sink
to the bottom or get bunched together in one place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the idea,&rdquo; smiled Mr. Anderson. &ldquo;All
those things and water go into one end of the mixer
and they come out at the other end concrete in a soft
state. Then the men shovel the stuff into the space
between the fence and the earth bank, making sure
that that widening trench at the foot is chock full and
they thump it down and let it &lsquo;set.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the cellar will look very ugly with that
old plank wall,&rdquo; decided Dorothy seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The planks will be taken away.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the concrete show lines where the cracks
between the boards were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see those rolls of heavy paper over
there? The planks
will be lined with that
so that the concrete
will come against a
perfectly smooth surface.
When the
wood is taken away
the men will go over
it with a smoothing
tool and when they
have finished even
your particular eye
will see nothing to
take exception to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I knew it
would be right somehow,&rdquo;
murmured
Dorothy, who was
afraid she had hurt
Mr. Anderson&rsquo;s feelings.
&ldquo;I just didn&rsquo;t
know how you managed
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the way the end of the wall would look
if you could slice down right through it,&rdquo; and the
contractor took out his notebook and drew a cross
section of the concrete wall showing its widened
foot.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the floor to be made of?&rdquo; asked Ethel
Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concrete&mdash;four inches of it,&rdquo; answered Mr.
Anderson promptly. &ldquo;It will slope a trifle toward
this end, and there a drainage pipe will be laid to
carry off any water used in washing the floor. Then
a layer of cement will go on top of the concrete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make it all smooth. It will be rounded up
at the corners and sides where it joins the walls, so
there won&rsquo;t be any chance for the dust to collect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cellar in our house is awfully damp,&rdquo; remarked
Ethel Brown. &ldquo;Sometimes you can see the
water dripping down the stones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The walls and the floor of this cellar will be
waterproofed with a mixture of rich cement and sand
mortar, and I think you&rsquo;ll find, young ladies, that
you&rsquo;ll have a cellar that&rsquo;ll be hard to beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contractor slapped his notebook emphatically
and beamed at them so amiably that they felt the
greatest confidence in what he proposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way, I haven&rsquo;t anything better to suggest,&rdquo;
said Dorothy dryly.</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson walked off, giving a roar of amusement
as he left them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does the sun rise from here?&rdquo; asked
Ethel Blue as she stood at the spot where was to be
the front of the house, and gazed about her.
&ldquo;Does the house face directly south?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, it faces just half way between south and
west. The corners of the house point to north,
south, east and west. Mother said that if the front
was due south the back would be due north and
she didn&rsquo;t want a whole side of her house facing
north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does have a chilly sound,&rdquo; shivered Ethel
Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a point stretching toward the north the
rooms that have a northern exposure will also have
the morning sun and the afternoon sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Aunt Louise will have her dining room
where the morning sun will shine in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, <i>ma&rsquo;am</i>,&rdquo; returned Dorothy emphatically.
&ldquo;It makes you feel better all day if you eat your
breakfast in the sunshine. By this plan of Mother&rsquo;s
every room in the house will have direct sunshine at
some part of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; approved Ethel Blue. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we
ask Mr. Anderson about making a bird&rsquo;s bath out of
cement?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;Ethel Brown and I saw
a beauty at Mrs. Schermerhorn&rsquo;s and perhaps he&rsquo;d
let us have some of the concrete to-morrow when the
men are mixing it, and we can try to make one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls raced over to the spot where the contractor
was just about to get into his Ford, and
stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you mind letting us have a little concrete
to-morrow to make a bird&rsquo;s bath with?&rdquo;
begged Dorothy breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bird&rsquo;s bath?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Anderson.
&ldquo;How are you going to make it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we put some concrete in a pan and
squeeze another pan down on to it and let it
harden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, something like that,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Anderson slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to make it yourselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; all three girls cried in chorus.</p>
<p>He smiled at their enthusiasm and offered a suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you want the bird&rsquo;s bath for your garden,
Miss Dorothy;&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you make a little
pool for the garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, could we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you could get a tub and lay down a flooring of
concrete and then put in another tub enough smaller
so that there would be a space between the walls,
then you could fill the space with concrete. When
it set, you could take out the inner tub after two or
three days and turn the concrete out of the outer tub
and there you&rsquo;d have a concrete tub that you could
move about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds great,&rdquo; beamed Dorothy, &ldquo;but
wouldn&rsquo;t it be awfully heavy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a better way, then. If you can make up
your mind exactly where you want to have it in your
garden you can have a hole dug, lay down your floor
of concrete and put your small tub on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see&mdash;then you fill the space between the tub
and the earth with concrete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely; thump it down hard and let it stand
untouched for a while. Then take away your tub,
and there you are again.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make the concrete floor and leave it,
can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed. You must have everything ready
to do the whole thing at once. Put in your tub
which is to be your mold, while the floor is still
plastic&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; inquired Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soft enough to mold; and then pour in the walls
right off quick. You can&rsquo;t fool round when you&rsquo;re
working with concrete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we keep the water fresh in the tub?&rdquo;
asked Ethel Blue of Dorothy.</p>
<p>Dorothy paused, not knowing what to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be fun to keep gold fish in it,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but they would have to have fresh water, wouldn&rsquo;t
they?&rdquo; She turned appealingly to Mr. Anderson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not hard to manage,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
can put a bit of broomstick between the earth wall
and the outer wall of your tub-mold and pour the
concrete around it. When the concrete has hardened
you pull out the stick and there is a hole. Then
you can have a drain dug that will tap that hole on
the outside and carry off the water through a few
lengths of drain pipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to prevent the water running off all the
time?&rdquo; Ethel Blue wanted to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a plug in it,&rdquo; answered the contractor
briefly. &ldquo;And there should be waterproofing stuff
mixed with the materials. You have your gardener
dig a hole in the garden,&rdquo; he said, adding, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
forget to have plenty of grease.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you grease your cake pans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the cake won&rsquo;t stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here. On the cellar wall we lined the inside
of the wooden forms with paper. That isn&rsquo;t so
easy with round forms, so you grease them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought there was any likeness between
concrete and cooking,&rdquo; laughed Ethel Brown as the
girls watched Mr. Anderson&rsquo;s skill in taking his little
car over the rough ground around the cellar excavation,
&ldquo;but there seems to be plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s chase off and see if we can collect the
things we shall need to-morrow,&rdquo; urged Dorothy.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to find Patrick and bring him here and
show him just where to dig the hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going to dig the hole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think just in the open place on top of the
ridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; objected Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t it be too warm in summer? If you&rsquo;re
going to have gold fish you don&rsquo;t want to boil them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water would get pretty hot in the sun,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; considered her cousin. &ldquo;What do
you think of a place under that tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought not to be too near the tree because the
roots will grow out a long way from the trunk of the
tree and they might get under the pool and break up
the concrete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, could a tender little thing like a root break
concrete that&rsquo;s as hard as stone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly can. Grandfather showed me a
crack in a concrete wall of his on the farm that was
made by the root of a big tree not far off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then we can&rsquo;t have our pool anywhere near
a tree. A shrub wouldn&rsquo;t hurt it, though; why can&rsquo;t
it go near those shrubs that are going to separate the
flower garden from the vegetable garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That place would be all right because there&rsquo;s a
tall spruce there that throws a shadow over the
shrubs for a part of the day. That&rsquo;s all you need;
you don&rsquo;t want to take away all the sunshine from the
pool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the exact spot was decided on and marked so
that Patrick should make no mistake, and then the
girls rushed off on a search for shallow basins and
a tub.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II
<br />PLAYING WITH CONCRETE</h2>
<p>It was not the Ethels and Dorothy alone who appeared
at the &ldquo;new place&rdquo; the next afternoon to
make the experiments with concrete. Helen, Ethel
Brown&rsquo;s elder sister, and her friend, Margaret Hancock,
of Glen Point, were so interested in the younger
girls&rsquo; account of what they were going to do with
Mr. Anderson&rsquo;s help that they came too.</p>
<p>As they puffed up the steep knoll on which the new
house was to stand they stopped beside the cellar
hole to see what progress had been made since the
day before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have just frisked along!&rdquo; Dorothy exclaimed
when she saw that not only was the inside
fence-mold all built but that the concrete floor was
laid and that the men were pouring the mixture in
between the planks and the earth wall and pounding
it down as they poured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Anderson said &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t fool round when
you&rsquo;re working with concrete,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ethel Brown repeated.
&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t, are they?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>The men were all working as fast as they could
move, some of them shovelling the materials into
the mixer, others running the machine, others wheeling
the wet concrete in iron barrows to the men at
the edge of the cellar who tamped it down as fast
as it was poured into the narrow space that defined
the growing wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When it is full, way up to the top, what happens
next?&rdquo; Dorothy inquired of Mr. Anderson
who came over to where they were standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re going to build on it a three foot wall
of concrete blocks to support the upper part of the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the wall that has the cellar windows in
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do make good big ones; Mother likes a
bright cellar,&rdquo; urged Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to make her a beauty,&rdquo; promised
the contractor. &ldquo;Come up into your garden now
and let&rsquo;s get this concrete work up there done.
Here, Luigi,&rdquo; he called to an Italian, &ldquo;bring us a
load of concrete over there,&rdquo; and he waved his hand
in the direction of the spot where Patrick had dug the
hole for the tub.</p>
<p>They all examined the hole with care and the
Ethels fitted in the tub and found that their digger
had done his work skilfully, since there were just
about three inches between the earth and the tub all
around. They pulled the tub out again and under
Mr. Anderson&rsquo;s direction they greased it thoroughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want to do every bit we can ourselves,&rdquo; they
insisted when he suggested that Luigi might do that
part for them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the hole for the drainage,&rdquo; he reminded
them. &ldquo;Have you got your stick? And on
which side are you going to have that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They surveyed the ground about the hole and decided
that a drainage pipe might run a few inches
underground for a short distance and discharge itself
at the edge of a bank below which a vegetable
garden was to lie.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p2.png" alt="The Way the Pool Looked When It Was Done" width="598" height="331" />
<p>The Way the Pool Looked When It Was Done</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re careful what you plant there it will be
an advantage to the ground to have this dampening
once in a while,&rdquo; said Mr. Anderson, who was something
of a gardener. &ldquo;There won&rsquo;t be enough water
to drown out any of your plants.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>Luigi emptied a load of concrete into the hole and
while he was gone to get a new supply the girls
thumped it down hard, fitted in the greased tub and
wedged a bit of broomstick which Roger, Ethel
Brown&rsquo;s brother, had cut for Dorothy into the space
between the tub and the earth just at the top of the
concrete flooring. When Luigi came back they were
ready to thump as he poured and three loads filled up
the space entirely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, Luigi will bring you one of the
smoothing tools that the men over there are using
and you can make the top look even,&rdquo; and Mr. Anderson
gave more instructions to the Italian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be pretty to have some plants at the edge
so they&rsquo;ll bend over and see themselves in the water,&rdquo;
suggested Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think there must be some water plants
that would grow inside without much trouble,&rdquo; Ethel
Blue said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must look that up; they&rsquo;d probably need a
little soil of some sort,&rdquo; Helen reminded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d be awfully pretty,&rdquo; said Dorothy complacently.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you seem to see it&mdash;with gold
fish swimming around among the stems?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dicky might lend us his old turtle,&rdquo; laughed
Ethel Brown. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s tired of taking care of it.
You could put a stick in here partly above the water,
for him to sun himself on. I don&rsquo;t see why he
wouldn&rsquo;t be quite happy here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky&rsquo;s turtle was a family joke. Dicky had
found him two years before and had taken him home
thinking he was a piece of stone. His excitement
and terror when the stone lying on the library table
stuck out first a head and then one leg after another
to the number of four, had never been forgotten by
the people who saw him at this thrilling moment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now for your bird&rsquo;s bath,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson reminded
his pupils. &ldquo;You have to work fast, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy brought out her two shallow basins, one
smaller than the other. The larger had its inside
well greased and the smaller was thoroughly rubbed
over on its under side. Into the larger they poured
about an inch of concrete and then squeezed the
smaller dish into it, but not so sharply that it cut
through. They filled in the crack between the two,
pushing and patting the mixture into place, and they
smoothed the edge so that it turned over the rim of
the larger bowl before they cut it off evenly all around
with a wire.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p3.png" alt="The Bird&rsquo;s Bath" width="554" height="173" />
<p>The Bird&rsquo;s Bath</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Mr. Anderson as he watched them.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see what will come from that. It might be
better done&mdash;&rdquo; at which the girls all pulled long
faces&mdash;&ldquo;but also, it might be worse, or I&rsquo;m very
much mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could make some garden furniture,&rdquo;
sighed Dorothy, holding up her dripping hands helplessly,
but at the same time gazing with joy at their
new manufacture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You could if you would make the forms,&rdquo; said
Mr. Anderson. &ldquo;All you need to do is to make a
bench inside of another bench and fill the space between
with concrete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds easy, but if you were a girl, Mr.
Anderson, you might find it a little hard to make the
forms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can all drive nails,&rdquo; insisted Ethel Brown
stoutly. &ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the others laughed at her and reminded her
that she would have to drive the nails through rather
heavy planking, so she gave up the notion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the walls going to be made of?&rdquo; Margaret
asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something fireproof, Mother said, but I don&rsquo;t
know what she finally decided on. I&rsquo;ll ask Mr. Anderson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plaster on hollow tile,&rdquo; the contractor answered
absent-mindedly over his shoulder, as he walked
briskly before them back to the cellar.</p>
<p>The girls saw that he was too full of business now
to pay any more attention to them, so they thanked
him for giving them so much time and made some investigations
on their own account among the piles of
material lying about on the grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if this could be &lsquo;hollow-tile,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ethel
Blue said to the rest as she came across a stack of
strange-looking pieces of brown earthenware.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly hollow,&rdquo; returned Ethel Brown,
&ldquo;but I always supposed tiles were flat things.
That&rsquo;s a tile Mother sets the teapot on to keep the
heat from harming the polish of the table.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>They stood about the pile of brown, square-edged
pipes, roughly glazed inside and out, through whose
length ran three square holes. They asked two
workmen as they passed what they were. One said
&ldquo;Hollow tile,&rdquo; and the other, &ldquo;Terra-cotta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect they&rsquo;re both right,&rdquo; Helen decided.
&ldquo;Probably they&rsquo;re hollow tile made of terra-cotta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought terra-cotta was lighter brown
and smooth. They make little images out of terra-cotta,&rdquo;
insisted Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen those,&rdquo; agreed Margaret, &ldquo;but I suppose
there can be different qualities of terra-cotta just
as there are different qualities of china.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This stuff is fireproof, any way,&rdquo; explained Dorothy.
&ldquo;I remember now hearing Mother and the
architect talking about it. And they said something
about a &lsquo;dead air space.&rsquo; That must mean the
holes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s dead air space for?&rdquo; inquired Ethel
Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it dries up the dampness, or keeps it out
so that it doesn&rsquo;t get into the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are useful old blocks, then, even if they
aren&rsquo;t pretty,&rdquo; decided Helen, patting the ugly pile.</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson strolled toward them again after
giving various directions to his men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just how is this tile used?&rdquo; inquired Dorothy,
as he seemed to be more at leisure now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We build a wall of this hollow tile,&rdquo; he answered;
&ldquo;then we put the plaster right on to it. Do
you see that the outside is rather rough? That is
so the plaster will have something to take hold of.
We mix it up of cement and lime and sand and put
on three coats. The first one is mixed with hair,
and mashed on hard so that it will stick and it is
roughened so that the next coat will stick to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the next coat made of the same stuff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without the hair; and the third coat is as thin
as cream and is flowed on to make a smooth-looking
outside finish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p4.png" alt="The Walls of Sweetbrier Lodge&mdash;Plaster on Hollow Tile" width="644" height="439" />
<p>The Walls of Sweetbrier Lodge&mdash;Plaster on Hollow Tile</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lot of work,&rdquo; commented Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not all we&rsquo;re going to do to your walls;
Mrs. Smith wants them to be a trifle yellowish in tone&mdash;a
little warmer than the natural color of the
plaster&mdash;so we&rsquo;re going to wash on some mineral
matter that will give them color and waterproof
them at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killing two birds,&rdquo; murmured Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then the whole house will look plastery except
the roof and chimneys,&rdquo; said Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Including the roof and chimneys,&rdquo; returned
Mr. Anderson. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to use concrete
shingles&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concrete shingles! Doesn&rsquo;t that sound funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are colored, so they look like green or red
shingles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What color is Mother going to have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dark green. The chimney is to be made of reinforced
concrete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Reinforced&rsquo; must mean &lsquo;strengthened,&rsquo; but
how do you strengthen it?&rdquo; inquired Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen how we build a mold to pour the
concrete in; inside of the mold we build a sort of cage
of steel rods. Don&rsquo;t you see that when the concrete
hardens it would be almost impossible for such a reinforced
piece of work to break through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t an earthquake break it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An earthquake might give a piece of solid concrete
such a twist that it would crack through, but
suppose the crack found itself up against a steel
rod? Don&rsquo;t you think it would complicate matters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls thought it would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad our chimney is going to be reinforced,&rdquo;
Dorothy exclaimed, &ldquo;because up on this
knoll we&rsquo;re going to feel the wind a lot and it would
be horrid if the chimney should fall down!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly would,&rdquo; agreed the Ethels, but Mr.
Anderson assured them that they need not be afraid
of any accident of the sort with a reinforced concrete
chimney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen skyscrapers going up in New York,&rdquo;
said Margaret &ldquo;and all the beams were of steel.
Are you going to use steel beams here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t often use steel construction for
small houses, but this house is going to be more fireproof
than most small houses even if it does have
wooden beams. You watch it as it goes on and notice
all the points that make for fireproofness. It
will interest you,&rdquo; Mr. Anderson promised as he
walked away.</p>
<p>The girls all washed their hands as well as they
could with the hose with which the workmen watered
the concrete mixture, but they had nothing to dry
them on and they walked down the road holding them
before them and waving them in the breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother will think we are crazy if she happens
to be looking out of the window,&rdquo; said Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aunt sent you a message, Dorothy,&rdquo; said
Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What aunt? I didn&rsquo;t know you had an aunt,&rdquo;
replied Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems like a new aunt to us; James and I
haven&rsquo;t seen her since we were little bits of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does she live?&rdquo; asked Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Washington. She&rsquo;s an interior decorator and
she&rsquo;s awfully busy, so when she has had to come on
to New York to buy materials or to see people she
has never had a chance to stay with us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is she going to make a visit this time?&rdquo; inquired
Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has come for a long visit now. She has a
commission to decorate a house in Englewood. It&rsquo;s
going to take her several weeks, and then she wants
to rest and do some studying and to make the rounds
of the decorators in the city, so it will be several
months before she goes back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue politely, and she
was glad she had thought so because Margaret said
at once, &ldquo;We think it&rsquo;s splendid. She&rsquo;s a young
aunt, lots and lots younger than Mother, and James
and I think she&rsquo;s loads of fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was her message to me?&rdquo; asked Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, we were telling her about the United Service
Club and the things we did&mdash;sending gifts to the
war orphans and celebrating holidays and our plans
for helping some poor women and children in the
summer and for taking care of the Belgian baby.
She was awfully interested and said she felt as if she
knew all of you people and the Watkinses quite well,
we talked about you so much. Then we told her
about Dorothy&rsquo;s house, and how Mrs. Smith had
said we might all give our opinions about the decorating,
and she asked us to tell you that she&rsquo;d be very
glad indeed to act as consulting decorator when you
come to the inside work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s awfully sweet of her!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dorothy. &ldquo;Mother isn&rsquo;t going to have a regular
decorator, and I know she&rsquo;ll be immensely pleased to
have Miss&mdash;what is your aunt&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Graham; she&rsquo;s our Aunt Daisy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;to have Miss Graham give us advice and
&lsquo;check up&rsquo; on our suggestions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the time your house is ready for that part she
will have finished her Englewood house; but she said
she&rsquo;d be glad to come over and see the house and the
plans any time when she was free for the afternoon,
and she hoped you&rsquo;d consult her about everything you
wanted to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daisy is a pretty name, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Ethel Blue
murmured to herself. &ldquo;I wish one of us was named
Daisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name is really Margaret; I&rsquo;m named after
her. Daisy is the nickname for Margaret, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lovely name,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And please tell Miss Daisy that I think she&rsquo;s the
finest ever, and Mother will think so, too, when I
tell her about this,&rdquo; added Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do ask her to come over to one of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.
meetings when we happen to be doing something
that will interest her,&rdquo; concluded Helen, who was the
president of the club.</p>

<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III
<br />THE CLUB SELECTS THE BENCHES</h2>
<p>It seemed to Dorothy and the Ethels that the outside
of Sweetbrier Lodge, as Mrs. Smith had determined
to call her house, went up with remarkable
speed, but that the inside would never be done&mdash;never!
Every day the girls walked down the road
after school, and stood and surveyed the general appearance
from the sidewalk and from across the
street and sometimes they went on to Mrs. Emerson&rsquo;s
and discussed vigorously as to whether the view
of the corner of the house that was to be seen now
would still be seen after the leaves came out or
whether the house would be entirely concealed by
the foliage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &lsquo;one of the things no feller knows,&rsquo;&rdquo;
Mr. Emerson quoted. &ldquo;We shall have to wait and
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get an idea how it is to look from the
road,&rdquo; said Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only there&rsquo;ll be a lot of planting,&rdquo; Dorothy explained.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a hedge along the street and
a lot of shrubs on the knoll and the house will be covered
with vines in the course of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another good point about concrete,&rdquo; declared
Mr. Emerson; &ldquo;vines don&rsquo;t injure it as they
do brick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have it entirely covered, then,&rdquo; laughed
Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was to be a bungalow,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Emerson. &ldquo;Your mother has always spoken of it
as a bungalow, but the plans I saw the men following
the other day when I went up the hill to take a
look at things, seemed to me like a two story house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother changed her mind,&rdquo; said Dorothy.
&ldquo;She thought a bungalow would be too crowded now
that we have little Belgian Elisabeth with us, so the
house is going to have two stories and an attic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. couldn&rsquo;t get on without Dorothy&rsquo;s
attic,&rdquo; smiled Ethel Brown, for almost all of the
presents for the Christmas Ship had been made in
the attic of Dorothy&rsquo;s present abiding place, and the
Club had had many meetings there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like having a well-thought-out
plan before you attempt building,&rdquo; said Mr. Emerson,
&ldquo;and that your mother had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She tried to think of every possible need, Ayleesabet&rsquo;s
as well as our own,&rdquo; continued Dorothy, using
the pronunciation that the Belgian baby had given
her own name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a good contractor in Anderson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t make the very lowest bid,&rdquo; said Dorothy.
&ldquo;There was one man who was lower, but he
was such a lot lower that Mother thought there must
be something the matter with the quality of the material
he used, or that he employed workmen so poor
that they might not do their work well, so she didn&rsquo;t
consider that offer at all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She was very wise,&rdquo; commended Mr. Emerson.
&ldquo;He might have spoiled the whole thing and have
cost her more money in the end by turning out a poor
job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the building was going on and before the inside
work was done the girls spent a good deal of
time in planning for the furnishing of the garden.
The flower and vegetable beds had all been arranged
some weeks before and many of them had been
planted, but the artistic part of the garden had been
left until there should be time to devote to it. Mrs.
Smith had promised Dorothy that she should have
the choice of the garden furniture, reserving for herself
a veto power if her daughter chose anything
that seemed to her entirely unsuitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I expect to use it,&rdquo; she said, smiling at
the girls who were listening to her.</p>
<p>The selection of the benches and tables and trellises
was made a subject of attention by the whole
United Service Club. A meeting was called in the
partly begun garden so that they might have the &ldquo;lie
of the land&rdquo; before them as they talked. Dorothy
took with her a number of catalogues from which to
select or to gather ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a good shelter of large trees already
provided for us,&rdquo; she said as they all seated themselves
in such shade as the young leaves made.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There ought to be a fine large settee under it
where we can have Club meetings all summer, no
matter how warm it is,&rdquo; urged Tom Watkins with
wise foresight. Tom and his sister, Della, came out
from New York for the club gatherings, and the
prospect of meeting out of doors instead of in the
attic, which was delightful in winter but not so attractive
in warm weather, made him offer this shrewd
suggestion.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p5.png" alt="&ldquo;A fine large settee&rdquo;" width="615" height="266" />
<p>&ldquo;A fine large settee&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said Dorothy again, opening
the various catalogues and spreading them on the
grass where they could all see them, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
think it would be pretty to have all the chairs and
benches of one pattern? Or don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would,&rdquo; answered Ethel Brown, examining
the pages carefully before she made her decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like them all alike. It would be messy
to have a lot of different patterns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel Blue, who had a good deal of artistic sense
and ability, nodded her agreement with this belief.
They all came to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, let&rsquo;s pick out the pattern,&rdquo; said Dorothy,
who had an orderly mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Something plain, so the visitor&rsquo;s eye won&rsquo;t be
drawn to the benches instead of the flowers,&rdquo; recommended
Helen. &ldquo;Suppose we were sitting here, for
instance, and looking toward the flower beds&mdash;there
will be some tables and chairs between us and the
flowers, probably&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the seeds will only grow,&rdquo; Dorothy sighed
comically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and we want to forget them and not have
them intrude on our attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct!&rdquo; James Hancock thumped the
ground by way of applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the plainest pattern there is?&rdquo; asked
Della, extending her hand for a book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one&mdash;but that&rsquo;s too plain,&rdquo; remonstrated
Ethel Blue. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so plain that it draws your attention
as much as if it were all fussed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They laughed at her disgust and urged her to
choose the next plainest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think this one with cross bars is pretty,&rdquo;
she decided seriously. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t get tired of
that&mdash;especially if they&rsquo;re all painted dark green
so you won&rsquo;t see them much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You girls seem to want to have invisible furniture,&rdquo;
grinned Roger. &ldquo;Me for something more
substantial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These will be substantial enough&mdash;they&rsquo;re
made of cypress,&rdquo; retorted Helen, &ldquo;but you don&rsquo;t
want to see a lot of chairs and benches when you
come out to observe the beauties of nature, my
child.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can bay the moon on a white bench with an
elaborate pattern just as musically as on a plain, dark
green one,&rdquo; insisted Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay any attention to him,&rdquo; urged Ethel
Brown, which crushing remark from a younger sister
was rewarded by a hair-pull effectively delivered by
Roger.</p>
<div class="img">

<p>&ldquo;Benches and chairs and small tables for lemonade and cocoa&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yow!&rdquo; squealed Ethel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now who&rsquo;s baying the moon?&rdquo; inquired her
brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s decide on the cross-barred kind,&rdquo; decreed
Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Lady of the Garden has made her decision,&rdquo;
announced James, tooting through his hands as if he
were a herald making an announcement. &ldquo;Now
for the shapes. How many are you going to have,
Lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there ought to be a very large bench that
would hold almost all the Club, and then one or two
smaller benches and two or three chairs and two
small tables for lemonade and cocoa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to hold the Secretary&rsquo;s book when she&rsquo;s
writing,&rdquo; urged Ethel Blue who held the office of
scribe and had not always found herself conveniently
situated to do her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bully bench for the whole U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.,&rdquo;
cried Tom. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s curved so it will fit right under
this semi-circle of trees as if it were made for this
very spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held up the picture of a wide bench with two
wings. It was greeted with applause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When that is made in the pattern we chose it
will be as pretty as any one could ask for,&rdquo; Dorothy
decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And painted green,&rdquo; added Ethel Blue, at
which they all laughed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m serious about the
green,&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see what I mean,
Dorothy?&rdquo; she continued, appealing to the person
who was to have the final decision on the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; replied Dorothy. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
mind what they say. Write down one of those,
Miss Secretary, and one of these right-angled ones&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you all of you think that&rsquo;s a comfy one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did, and they also approved of the single
bench and the chairs and the small tables.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be all jammed up in this corner, of
course,&rdquo; Dorothy explained gravely, &ldquo;but when we
have a Club meeting we can bring them together if
we want to and room enough for everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p7.png" alt="&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an arbor that you can walk through&rdquo;" width="682" height="651" />
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an arbor that you can walk through&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we were all to sit on the big bench,&rdquo;
objected Tom with an air of deep disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we shall if you boys are too lazy to pull the
other benches and chairs over here,&rdquo; answered Dorothy.
&ldquo;If we have plenty we can arrange them any
way we want to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What about
trellises?&rdquo; inquired
Ethel Blue
who had been continuing
her researches
in the catalogues.
&ldquo;Here
are some beauties.
Don&rsquo;t you think
you&rsquo;ll need some?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She certainly
will if that Dorothy
Perkins rambler
rose gets busy
as it ought to,&rdquo; decided
Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a
lot of vines and
tall things if they&rsquo;ll
only grow,&rdquo; said
Dorothy hopefully.
&ldquo;I think there
ought to be one or
two flat ones and
an arbor that will
be a trellis.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p8.png" alt="A Trellis for the Rambler Rose" width="447" height="1024" />
<p>A Trellis for the Rambler Rose</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s an arbor
that you can
walk through or
sit down in while
you admire your
plants, and you will be protected from the sun,&rdquo; Tom
pointed out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And that same one with a lattice back and a
bench inside makes a pretty good imitation of a summer
house,&rdquo; suggested Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have one apiece of those, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count up and see how much stuff you&rsquo;re planning
to order,&rdquo; Roger suggested. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a huge
big place to set them in here but you don&rsquo;t want too
much wood work, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came to the conclusion that there were not
too many for the size of the grounds and were well
satisfied with their choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see how well we&rsquo;re going to see the
house from here?&rdquo; Dorothy asked.</p>
<p>They all agreed that it would be very pretty from
that point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My idea is that the garden must look well from
the house,&rdquo; said Dorothy. &ldquo;Mother wants a pergola
somewhere. Don&rsquo;t you think the right place
for it would be covering a walk leading from the
house to here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great notion,&rdquo; approved Tom. &ldquo;As
you came toward the garden you&rsquo;d have a&mdash;what do
you call the effect&mdash;where you see a view framed
in somehow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean a vista?&rdquo; asked Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. There would be a vista of the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will be lovely!&rdquo; Helen said decisively.
&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t see why there shouldn&rsquo;t be a trellis
framing a view of the woods toward Grandfather
Emerson&rsquo;s; that would be pretty, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p9.png" alt="A Trellis Framing a View of the Woods" width="556" height="701" />
<p>A Trellis Framing a View of the Woods</p>
</div>
<p>Dorothy went over to look at the drawing that
Helen held up to her and decided straightway that
it was worth trying. They all went toward the upper
side of the garden where young peach trees were
planted on the northern slope of the ridge and chose
a spot which gave a charming picture of the adjoining
field with its brook and the woods beyond.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The birds are coming along pretty well now,&rdquo;
announced James who had been lying on his back
gazing up into the branches swaying in the upper
breeze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to build any bird houses, Dorothy?&rdquo;
asked Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;ll have to if we want them to stay
late in the season or all winter,&rdquo; replied her cousin.
&ldquo;But bird houses are so ugly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the modern ones,&rdquo; interposed James eagerly.
&ldquo;You make them out of pieces of the
trunks of trees with the bark on, and you fix up
a platform with a stick on it that has spikes to
hang suet on and they aren&rsquo;t a bit conspicuous and
lots of birds will stay all winter that otherwise would
go south before the regular Palm Beach rush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must have some then,&rdquo; Dorothy made up
her mind. &ldquo;Say &lsquo;Robert of Lincoln&rsquo;?&rdquo; she begged
Ethel Brown, who was the Club&rsquo;s reciter, &ldquo;and then
we&rsquo;ll go home and have some cocoa and cookies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do, Ethel Brown;&rdquo; &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; were the cries
from all the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. members as they settled themselves
to listen to Bryant&rsquo;s charming verses.</p>

<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV
<br />CHRISTOPHER FINDS A NEW LODGING</h2>
<p>There was trouble in chicken circles. The
young chicks that the Ethels and Dorothy had
helped Dicky move from the incubator to the brooder
were making rapid progress toward broiler size, and
had been transferred to a run of their own where
they scratched and dozed happily through the long
spring days. Dicky and Ayleesabet, the Belgian
baby, were examining them on a late June afternoon.
Dicky had brought with him his old friend, the
turtle, which had not yet been moved to Dorothy&rsquo;s
pool, since his present owner wanted to wait until
his aunt&rsquo;s house was occupied before he let so cherished
a possession go where he might slip away and
his loss, perhaps, be unnoticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re living right there tho you can watch
Chrithtopher Columbuth all the time I&rsquo;ll let you have
him,&rdquo; Dicky had promised Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see myself in my mind&rsquo;s eye sitting side of the
tank all day and night holding the turtle&rsquo;s paw!&rdquo;
Dorothy exclaimed when she told the Ethels of
Dicky&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Perhaps because he felt that he was soon to be
parted from his old comrade Dicky&rsquo;s affection for
Christopher seemed to increase and he developed a
habit of carrying him about, sometimes in his hand
and sometimes in a little basket which Dorothy had
made for Christopher&rsquo;s Christmas gift. To-day he
had brought him to the chicken yard in his hand and
had laid him down on the ground while he examined
his flock and called Ayleesabet&rsquo;s attention to the beauties
of this or the other miniature hen.</p>
<p>Elisabeth&rsquo;s words were few, but she managed to
make her wants and opinions known with surprising
ease, and she never had the least trouble about
expressing her emotions. Her little playmate had
learned this and therefore when he heard loud howls
behind his back he knew that it was not anger that
was disturbing the usually placid baby, but terror.
Shriek after shriek arose although it seemed to him
that he turned about almost instantly.</p>
<p>He was not in time, however, to prevent her from
being thrown down in some mysterious way, or to
see the cause of the commotion among the chickens.
They fluttered and squawked and ran to and fro,
tumbling over each other and running with perfect
indifference over the baby as she lay yelling on the
ground. Her blue romper legs came up every now
and then out of the mass of chicken feathers, and
their kicking only added to the disturbance and confusion
of the chicks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>The hubbub did not go unnoticed. Roger ran
from his vegetable garden to see what was the matter;
Helen appeared from her garden of wild
flowers; Miss Merriam, the baby&rsquo;s caretaker, ran
from the porch where she was talking with the Ethels
who were waiting for the out-of-town members of
the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. to arrive. At the moment when all
these people were rushing to the rescue, Margaret
and James Hancock, just off the Glen Point street
car, hurried from the corner, and Della and Tom
Watkins, arrived by the latest train from New York,
burst open the gate in their excitement.</p>
<p>To meet all these inquiries came Dicky, tugging
after him by the leg, the baby, howling pitifully by
this time as she was dragged over the grass. Miss
Merriam seized her and hugged her tight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the little darling precious?&rdquo;
she crooned.</p>
<p>Ayleesabet gathered herself together courageously
and her sobbing died away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it all about?&rdquo; Miss Merriam inquired
of Dicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Dicky, his own lip trembling
as he tried to understand the rapid, thrilling experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Gertrude what happened,&rdquo; Miss Merriam
urged the baby, wiping away her tears and setting
her down on her feet on the grass just as Christopher
Columbus bumped his way over the sod to join them.</p>
<p>Ayleesabet&rsquo;s conversational powers were not equal
to the explanation, but her little hands could tell a
great deal, and her caretaker was skilled in interpreting
them. She pointed to the turtle and called him by
the nickname that Dicky had given him, &ldquo;Chriththy&rdquo;;
then she spread out her fat little fingers and
waved a forward motion with her hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chrissy stuck out his head and legs and walked
ahead,&rdquo; interpreted Miss Merriam. &ldquo;Where was
he, Dicky?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the chicken yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elisabeth was kneeling beside the turtle now, tapping
his shell with a chubby forefinger; after which
she rolled over on her back and screamed.</p>
<p>Miss Merriam shook her head at this demonstration,
but Dicky translated it out of his previous experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chickenth hit hith thhell with their beakth,
and, when he moved they were frightened and
knocked her over,&rdquo; he guessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what happened, I believe,&rdquo; said
Roger, setting Elisabeth on her feet once more.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the chickens run like anything from Christopher,
and probably they ran between the baby&rsquo;s
legs and upset her and then scampered all over her.
I don&rsquo;t wonder she was scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christopher gave no testimony in the case. He
may have been overcome by the confusion; at any
rate he withdrew into his shell and preserved a
studied calm from which he could not be roused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you can have him,&rdquo; said Dicky suddenly
to Dorothy, who had come through the fence at the
corner where her yard joined her cousins&rsquo;. &ldquo;He
botherth me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Dorothy. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take him
over to Sweetbrier Lodge this afternoon. We&rsquo;re all
going over there anyway&mdash;bring him along, Dicky.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>So the procession set forth, Dicky and his shell-covered
friend at the fore, escorted by all the rest
of the United Service Club, while Miss Merriam and
her charge, whose walking ability had not yet developed
much speed, brought up the rear.</p>
<p>As they all toiled up the hill to Sweetbrier Lodge
Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Morton came out on the veranda
of the new house to watch them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anything happened?&rdquo; called Mrs. Smith
as soon as they were within earshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re just bringing Christopher over to his
new home,&rdquo; Dorothy explained to her mother.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">&ldquo;&lsquo;The time of the singing of birds is come,</p>
<p class="t">And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land,&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>quoted Mrs. Morton. &ldquo;I used to think that that
meant a turtle like Dicky&rsquo;s and not a turtle-dove,&rdquo;
and the two mothers laughed and disappeared within
the house while the younger people kept on to the
garden and the concrete pool.</p>
<p>When they reached there Dicky gazed at the pool
in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ithn&rsquo;t any water in it,&rdquo; he objected, shaking
his head doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can reach it with the hose and fill it up in no
time,&rdquo; his cousin explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll run out of the hole,&rdquo; pointing to the hole
made by the broomstick when the concrete was soft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put a plug in the hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t any log to sit on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger will find him a stick.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to leave him here all alone,&rdquo;
screamed Dicky, overcome by a renewal of his former
misgivings. Casting himself on the ground he
hugged his treasure to his breast and waved his legs
in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can take him back again if you want to,&rdquo;
Ethel Brown reminded him, &ldquo;but you know he&rsquo;s always
getting into trouble with the chickens now.
He seems to run away every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the memory of the latest encounter between
Christopher and the chicks with Elisabeth&rsquo;s overthrow,
flashed before him, Dicky howled again.
There seemed to be no haven on earth for his favorite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; suggested Dorothy
soothingly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down to the house. The
laundry is finished, and we can put him in one of the
tubs there until this pool is fixed to suit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;th dark in the laundry,&rdquo; objected Dicky
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in this laundry. You see,&rdquo; explained Dorothy,
sitting down beside the sufferer and patting him
gently, &ldquo;the house is built on the side of a hill, so
the laundry has full sized windows and is bright
and cheerful though it&rsquo;s on a level with the cellar.
I think Christopher will like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky stood up, his face smeared with tears, but
a new interest gleaming in his reddened eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; urged Ethel Blue, tactfully; &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
all go and see if we can&rsquo;t make him comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pick up a piece of log for him as we go
along,&rdquo; promised Roger, and he and Tom and James
went off towards the woods to look for just the right
thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a perfectly dandy cellar. Why, it&rsquo;s as
bright as the upper part of the house!&rdquo; exclaimed
Margaret as the procession invaded the lower regions
of the Lodge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it fine!&rdquo; agreed Dorothy. &ldquo;The workmen
have cleared it all up, and, if this part were all,
it might be lived in right off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whitewashed walls make it look bright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the large windows! I never saw such windows
in a cellar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother says I may put little cheesecloth curtains
in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curtains will look sweet the day after you take
in the winter supply of coal,&rdquo; grinned Roger, who
appeared with the other boys, carrying Christopher&rsquo;s
bit of log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t look dirty, if that&rsquo;s what you mean
by &lsquo;sweet,&rsquo;&rdquo; Dorothy retorted. &ldquo;Look&mdash;&rdquo; and
she opened the door of a coal bin&mdash;&ldquo;the coal is put
in through a concrete chute that leads directly into
the bin and the bin is entirely shut off from the cellar.
No dust floats out of that, young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you get the coal out?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a little door that slides up and catches.
You notice that the floor of the bin isn&rsquo;t level with
the cellar floor; it&rsquo;s raised to make it a comfortable
height for shoveling. Under it is the place for the
logs for the open fires. There are two bins, one for
furnace coal and the other for the coal for the
stoves, and the kindling wood goes in this third
one. They are all together and large enough but
not too large, and the furnace coal is near the boiler
and the small coal is near the laundry and the wood
is close to the dumb waiter that will take that and the
clean clothes upstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All as compact as a cut-out puzzle,&rdquo; approved
Roger. &ldquo;I take off my hat to this arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; courtesied Dorothy. &ldquo;Mother
and I worked that out together, and we&rsquo;re rather
pleased with it ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you do with the ashes?&rdquo; asked Roger,
who took care of several furnaces in the winter time,
and therefore made his examination as a specialist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put them down that chute with a swinging door
and into a covered can. It will be hard for the
ashes to fly there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the concrete floor we superintended,&rdquo;
said Helen, looking at it closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All smooth and well drained with rounded edges.
It&rsquo;s going to be as clean as a whistle down here. See
the metal ceiling? That&rsquo;s for fire prevention, and
so is the sprinkler system and there&rsquo;s a metal covered
door at the head of the cellar stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There seems to be a lot of machinery for a small
house,&rdquo; observed James as he carried his examination
around the space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother said she couldn&rsquo;t afford luxuries but she
could afford comforts and these are some of the comforts,&rdquo;
smiled Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not very pretty comforts,&rdquo; remarked Ethel
Blue dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Handsome is as handsome does,&rsquo;&rdquo; quoted her
cousin. &ldquo;When these things get to working you
won&rsquo;t care whether they&rsquo;re beautiful to look at or
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the heating system&mdash;steam or hot
water?&rdquo; asked Tom, standing before the boiler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot water. They say it&rsquo;s more convenient for
a small house because you don&rsquo;t have to keep up such
a big fire all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so; in steam heating there has to be
fire enough to make steam, anyway, doesn&rsquo;t
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the steam in the pipes cools it turns to
water and dribbles away, but in the hot water system
there will be some heat in the outside of your radiator
as long as the water inside has any warmth at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does the expense compare?&rdquo; inquired
James who was always interested in the financial side
of all questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hot water system is said to be cheaper,&rdquo; replied
Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are there so many pipes?&rdquo; asked Ethel
Brown, looking with a puzzled air at the collection
before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me lecture on heating!&rdquo; laughed Dorothy;
&ldquo;but I did study it all out with Mother, so I think I&rsquo;m
telling you the truth about it. There have to be two
sets of pipes, one to take the hot water to the radiators
and the other to bring it back after it has
cooled.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There seem to be big pipes and small ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mains and branch pipes they call them. The
man who put these in said this house was especially
well arranged for piping because it wouldn&rsquo;t take any
more pressure to force the water into one radiator
than another. He says there&rsquo;s going to be a good
even heat all over everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a lot of difference between radiators
for steam and those for hot water, is there?&rdquo; asked
Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you have to put something with water in it
on top of both kinds to make the air of the room
moist. Here you have to open the air valve yourself
and let out the air that accumulates in the radiator.
In the steam ones they are automatically
worked by steam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be much air in the hot water radiator,
I should think,&rdquo; said Margaret thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t. You only have to open the valve
two or three times in the course of the winter. The
biggest difference is that the hot water system has to
have an expansion tank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, when steam is shut up it just presses
harder than ever, but when water is heated it swells
and it&rsquo;s likely to burst open whatever it&rsquo;s in, so there
has to be an open tank up at the top of the house
where it can go and swell around all it wants to,&rdquo;
laughed Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What are these affairs?&rdquo; inquired Margaret
who had been looking at two other arrangements
near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That one is a gas thing for heating water in
summer when there isn&rsquo;t any other fire. There&rsquo;s a
tiny flame burning all the time, and when the water is
drawn out of the tank the flame becomes larger automatically
and heats up a new supply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine scheme; you don&rsquo;t have to heat the
house up and yet the water is always ready. What&rsquo;s
the other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s to burn up the garbage. In the kitchen
there&rsquo;s a tiny closet for the garbage pail. It&rsquo;s ventilated
from the outside. There is a thing that burns
the garbage and makes it heat the water, but Mother
decided that we had so small a family that there
might be days when there wouldn&rsquo;t be fuel enough
to make a decent fire, so we&rsquo;d better have the gas
heater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other would be economical for a hotel,&rdquo; observed
prudent James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the refrigerating plant,&rdquo; Dorothy said,
motioning toward a tank and a set of pipes and a
small motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to cut out the iceman?&rdquo; grinned Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be independent of him. Mother
doesn&rsquo;t like natural ice, any way; she went over to
the Rosemont pond last winter when the men were
cutting and the ice was so dirty she made up her mind
right off that she didn&rsquo;t want any more of it. This
thing will chill the refrigerator up in the kitchen and
pipes from it are going under the flooring of the
drawing room and the dining room so they can be
made comfy in summer.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you can cut them off in winter!&rdquo; and
Roger gave a tremendous shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can,&rdquo; Dorothy reassured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It makes small cakes of ice too, so we can always
have plenty for the Club lemonades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know but I think that&rsquo;s more useful than
the heating arrangements,&rdquo; approved plump little
Della.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re fat,&rdquo; responded Tom with
brotherly frankness. &ldquo;You think you suffer most
in summer, but if you didn&rsquo;t have any heat in winter
you&rsquo;d change your cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I should, but I do nearly <i>melt</i> in warm
weather,&rdquo; sighed Della.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mean to if we can help it,&rdquo; laughed
Dorothy. &ldquo;This is the air-washing arrangement
over here,&rdquo; went on Dorothy, as she continued her
round of the cellar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Air-washing!&rdquo; was the general chorus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as we have a little motor we&rsquo;re going to
make it useful. There&rsquo;s a small fan here that brings
in the fresh air. It goes into a &lsquo;spray chamber&rsquo;
and is washed free of dust with water that is cold in
summer and warm in winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see clearly that the temperature of this castle
is going to be just right,&rdquo; exclaimed Roger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After the air leaves the spray chamber it goes
over some plates that take all the moisture out of it,
and then the fan forces it through the pipes that go
into every room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those the little gratings I noticed in all the
rooms the other day?&rdquo; asked Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are the ventilators. Don&rsquo;t you think
we&rsquo;ve made everything very compact here? All
these pipes take up very little room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty little!&rdquo; commended Roger. &ldquo;And
they&rsquo;re all open so you can get at them without any
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a scheme Patrick suggested,&rdquo; laughed
Dorothy, pointing upward to what looked like a concrete
shelf with an upturned border almost at the top
of the cellar wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it for?&rdquo; asked Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shelf is directly underneath the seat beside
the fireplace in the drawing room. Patrick
plans to save himself the trouble of carrying up the
logs by piling them on this shelf down here. Then
he lifts the cover of the seat upstairs and all he has
to do is to take out his wood and make his fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That certainly is a cracker-jack labor saving device!
Good for Patrick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s especially tickled with the vacuum cleaner
run by this same little motor. You ought to hear
him talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are these cupboards for?&rdquo; asked Helen
who had been exploring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That one with the glass doors is for preserves,
and the place in the other corner that has a fence for
its two inside walls is a place for cleaning silver and
shoes and lamps and brasses. See&mdash;there are cupboards
along the inside of the fence. They hold all
the cleaning materials, and the cleaner can sit in a
swing chair in the middle and use a different part of
the concrete shelf against the two cellar walls for
boots or fire-irons or knives and forks or lamps. At
one end is a sink so he can have what water he needs
for his work and he can wash his hands when he turns
from one kind of cleaning to another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he isn&rsquo;t all smothered up in a small room.
Who thought of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patrick and I worked that out together. Patrick
has lots of ingenuity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say you had, too!&rdquo; exclaimed Della,
admiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where Dorothy does her carpentering,&rdquo;
cried James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may move that bench up in the attic later,&rdquo; explained
Dorothy, &ldquo;but I thought I&rsquo;d leave it here
until the house was done, because there are apt to be
little things to be hammered and nailed for some
time, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long are you going to be before you fikth
a plathe for Chrithopher Columbuth?&rdquo; demanded
Dicky, whose patience was entirely exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make him happy right here and now,&rdquo; answered
Dorothy briskly, throwing open the door of
the laundry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>The sun shone gayly on the concrete floor and the
room was a cheerful spot. An electric washing machine
stood ready although covered tubs were built
against the wall for use in emergencies, and at one
side was a drying closet. There were numerous plugs
against the wall for the attachment of pressing irons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked Ethel Brown, lifting a
cover of a hopper at the base of a chute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the chute for soiled clothes. The other
end is on the bedroom floor, and it saves carrying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as good as Patrick&rsquo;s log device!&rdquo; smiled
Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I put Christopher&rsquo;s log in here?&rdquo; asked
Roger, lifting the top of one of the stationary tubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, fix it so he can crawl up and sit in the sunshine
where it strikes the tub. We&rsquo;ll have to draw
some water from the hydrant outside; the water isn&rsquo;t
turned on in the house yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger picked up a pail that was standing near by
and went up the cellar stairs two at a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; he said to Dicky when he came back,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lift you up and you can put Christopher into
his new abode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky deposited his charge gently on the log and
he lay there poking out his head to enjoy the sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you bring some bits of meat for him?&rdquo;
Roger asked.</p>
<p>For answer Dicky turned out of the pocket of his
rompers a handful of chopped beef.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly unappetizing in appearance,&rdquo; said
Tom, wrinkling his nose, &ldquo;but I dare say Christopher
is not particular.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V
<br />THE LAW OF LAUGHTER</h2>
<p>The Mortons were sitting on their porch on a
warm evening waving fans and trying to think
that the coming night promised comfortable sleep.
The Ethels sat on the upper step, Roger was
stretched on the floor at one side, Helen sat beside
her mother&rsquo;s hammock which she kept in gentle motion
by an occasional movement of her hand, and
Dicky was dozing in a large chair. In a near-by
tree an insect insisted that &ldquo;Katy did,&rdquo; and in the
grass a cricket chirruped its shrill call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do feel that Aunt Louise&rsquo;s being able to build
this pretty house after all her years of wandering is
about the nicest thing that ever happened out of a
fairy story,&rdquo; murmured Helen softly to her mother,
but loudly enough for the others to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are people who talk about the law of
compensation,&rdquo; smiled Mrs. Morton in the darkness.
&ldquo;They think that if one good is lacking in our lives
other goods take its place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that everything that happens to us
comes because we have obeyed or disobeyed God&rsquo;s
laws. Sometimes we are quite unconscious of disobeying
them, but the law has to work out just as if
we knew all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For instance?&rdquo; came a deep voice from the
floor, indicating that Roger had awakened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the time you walked off the
end of the porch one day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say I did! My nose aches at the mere
thought of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t know anything about the law of gravitation,
but the law worked in your case just as if you
had known all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m bound to state that it did,&rdquo; confirmed
Roger, still gently rubbing his nose as he lay in the
shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems as if it might have held up for a little
boy who didn&rsquo;t know what he was going to get by
disobeying it,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t and it never does,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
Morton. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one reason why we ought to try
to learn what God&rsquo;s laws are just as fast and as
thoroughly as we can; not only the laws of nature
like the law of gravitation, but laws of morality and
justice and right thinking and unselfishness and kindness
toward others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes mighty mean people seem to prosper,&rdquo;
said Ethel Brown, with a hint of rebellion in
her voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because those people obey to the letter
the law that controls prosperity of a material kind.
A man may be cruel to his wife and unkind to his
children, but he may have a genius for making
money. Some people call it the law of compensation.
I call it merely an understanding of the financial
law and a lack of understanding of the law of
kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what law dear Aunt Louise could
have broken to have made her have such a hard
time,&rdquo; wondered Ethel Blue. &ldquo;Her husband being
killed and her having to wander about without a
home for so many years&mdash;that seems like a hard
punishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men have decided that &lsquo;ignorance of the law is
no excuse&rsquo;!&rdquo; said her aunt, &ldquo;and the same thing
is true of laws that are not man-made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems awfully hard,&rdquo; objected Helen; &ldquo;it
doesn&rsquo;t seem fair to punish a person for what he
doesn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a cannibal should come to Rosemont and
should kill some one and have a barbecue, we should
think that he ought to be deprived of his liberty
because he was a dangerous person to have about,
even if we felt sure that he did not know that he
was doing an act forbidden by New Jersey law.
The position is that although a person may be
ignorant of the law it is his business to know it.
That seems to be the way with the higher laws; we
may break them in our ignorance&mdash;but we ought
not to be ignorant. We ought to try just as hard
as we know how all the time to do everything as
well as we can and to be as good as we can. If
we never let ourselves do a mean act or think a
mean thought we&rsquo;re bound to come to an understanding
of the great laws sooner than if we just jog along
not thinking anything about them. I believe one
reason why your Aunt Louise was so slow in reaching
the end of her troubles after Uncle Leonard died
was because she was unable to control her sorrow.
She has told me that she was completely crushed by
his death and the condition of poverty in which she
found herself with a little child&mdash;Dorothy&mdash;to
take care of.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame her,&rdquo; murmured Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She blames herself, because she has learned
that giving way to grief paralyzes all the powers that
God has given us to carry on the work of life with.
If our minds are filled with gloom our bodies don&rsquo;t
behave as they ought to&mdash;I dare say even you children
know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; agreed Ethel Blue, who was sensitive
and imaginative and suffered unnecessarily over
many things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mind doesn&rsquo;t go, either,&rdquo; Roger added.
&ldquo;I know when I got in the dumps last spring about
graduating I couldn&rsquo;t do a thing. My work went
worse than ever. It was only when Mr. Wheeler&rdquo;&mdash;referring
to the principal of the high school&mdash;&ldquo;jollied
me up and told me I was getting on as well
as the rest of the fellows that I took a brace; and
you know I did come out all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say you did, dear,&rdquo; acknowledged his
mother proudly. &ldquo;Instances like that make you
understand how necessary it is to be brave and to
be filled with joy because life is going on as well
as it is. It is our duty to make the most of everything
that is given us&mdash;our bodies, our minds, our
spirits&mdash;and if courage will help or joy will help
then we must cultivate courage and joy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did Aunt Louise see that after a while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a long time, she says. After the shock
of Uncle Leonard&rsquo;s sudden death had worn away
somewhat she began naturally to have a little more
courage&mdash;not to be so completely crushed as she
was at first. Then she saw that when she was feeling
brave she could accomplish more, and succeed
better in new undertakings. If she went to ask for
work somewhere and had no hope that she would
receive it she usually did not receive it; but if she
went feeling that this day was to be one of success
for her it usually was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she went in with a sort &lsquo;Of course
you&rsquo;ll give it to me&rsquo; air that made the men she was
asking think of &lsquo;of course&rsquo; they would,&rdquo; smiled
Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it. Then she says that she found
out that there was real value in laughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In laughter!&rdquo; repeated Ethel Brown. &ldquo;Why
laughter is just foolishness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed; laughter is the outward expression
of delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Chesterfield told his son he hoped he&rsquo;d
never hear him laugh in all his life,&rdquo; offered Roger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Chesterfield hated noisy laughter as much
as I do. There&rsquo;s nothing more annoying than
empty, silly giggling and laughter; but the laughter
that means real delight over something worth being
delighted at&mdash;that&rsquo;s quite another matter. Lord
Chesterfield and I are agreed in being opposed to
a vulgar <i>manner</i> of laughing, but we are also agreed
in believing that delight needs expression. Isn&rsquo;t it
in that same letter that he says he hopes he will often
see his son smile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same place,&rdquo; responded Roger briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Louise says she found that even if she
wasn&rsquo;t feeling really gay she could raise her spirits
by doing her best to laugh at something. If you
hunt hard enough there is almost always something
funny enough to laugh at within reach of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like Dicky here snoozing away as soundly as
if he were in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little man. You needn&rsquo;t carry him up yet,
though. He&rsquo;s not uncomfortable there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I think is perfectly wonderful
about Aunt Louise,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue; &ldquo;she takes
so much pleasure out of little things. She&rsquo;s interested
in everything the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. does, and she wants
to help on anything the town undertakes&mdash;you know
how nice she was about the school gardens&mdash;and
sometimes when a day comes that seems just stupid
with nothing to do at all, if you go over to Aunt
Louise&rsquo;s she&rsquo;ll tell you something she&rsquo;s seen or heard
that day that you never would have noticed for yourself
and that really is interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She gets their full value out of everything that
passes before her eyes. It&rsquo;s the wisest thing to do.
The big things of life are more absorbing but very
few of us encounter the big things of life. Most of
us meet the small matters, the everyday happenings,
and nothing else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t life full of a mess of &rsquo;em!&rdquo; ejaculated
Roger. &ldquo;Getting up and dressing and brushing
your hair and eating three meals a day have to be
done three hundred sixty-five times a year; whereas
you hear some splendid music or come across a fine
new poem or find yourself in a position where you
can do a real kindness about once in a cat&rsquo;s age.
Queer, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just why it&rsquo;s a good plan to see the opportunities
in the little things. If we see with clear
eyes we may be able to do some small kindnesses
oftener than &lsquo;once in a cat&rsquo;s age.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s certainly
true that the everyday troubles, the trifling annoyances,
are really harder to bear than the big troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-o-o!&rdquo; disclaimed Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big troubles give you a bigger shock, but
then you pull yourself together and summon your
strength, and strength to endure them comes. But
the small matters&mdash;they come so often and they
seem such pin pricks that it seems not worth while to
call upon your powers of endurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet if you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;re as cross as two sticks all
the time,&rdquo; finished Helen. &ldquo;I know how it is. It&rsquo;s
like having a serious wound or a mosquito bite.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>They all laughed, for Roger, as if to illustrate her
remarks, gave a slap at a buzzing enemy at just the
appropriate moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing that helps to make Aunt Louise
a happy woman now is that she is at peace not only
with everybody on earth but also with herself. If
she makes a mistake she doesn&rsquo;t fret about it; she
does her best to remedy it, and she does her best not
to repeat it. &lsquo;Once may be excusable ignorance,&rsquo;
she says, &lsquo;but twice is stupidity,&rsquo; and then she tells
the tale of the boy who was walking across a field
and fell into a dry well which he knew nothing
about. He roared loudly and after a time a farmer
heard him and pulled him out. The next day he
was walking across the same field and he fell again
into the same well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He set up the same roar, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A perfect imitation of the previous one. The
same farmer came. When he looked down the well
and saw the same boy he said disgustedly, &lsquo;Yesterday
I thought ye were a poor, unknowin&rsquo; lad; to-day
I know ye&rsquo;re a sad fool.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they all laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s always cheerful and always affectionate
and she&rsquo;s as dear as she can be and I&rsquo;m glad she&rsquo;s
going to have this lovely house and I wish we had
one just like it,&rdquo; cried Helen in a burst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a good house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t belong to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Army and Navy people can&rsquo;t expect to own
houses, my child. You don&rsquo;t need to have that told
you at this late day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know that. If Father weren&rsquo;t so keen on
having us all together while we&rsquo;re being educated we
wouldn&rsquo;t have been in Rosemont as long as we have;
but I sometimes envy the people who have a home
of their own that they are sure to stay in for ever
so many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you feel that way you must think of the
many advantages of the Army and Navy children.
If your father had not been on the Pacific station
when you were the Ethels&rsquo; age you wouldn&rsquo;t have
had a chance to see California when you were old
enough to enjoy it and remember it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, Mother. I didn&rsquo;t mean to growl. I
just thought that Father had as much money as Aunt
Louise from his father, and he had his salary besides,
and yet we haven&rsquo;t a house of our own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a good many of Uncle Sam&rsquo;s houses,
which is more than your Aunt Louise has had. But
you must remember that her inheritance from your
Grandfather Morton was accumulating for many
years while her family didn&rsquo;t know where she was,
while your father and Ethel Blue&rsquo;s father have been
spending the income of theirs all along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Roger has had a lot of children to spend
his on, but Father hasn&rsquo;t had any one but me,&rdquo; said
Ethel Blue, whose life had been entirely spent with
her cousins because her mother had died when she
was a tiny baby. Never before had she thought
whether her father, who was a captain in the Army,
had any money or not. Now she saw that he must
be better provided with it than his brother, her Uncle
Roger, the father of Ethel Brown and Helen and
Roger and Dicky, who was a Lieutenant in the
Navy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your father is always generous with his money,
but I dare say he is saving it for some time when
he will want it,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know when he&rsquo;ll want it any more than
he does now,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;ll want to have a house of his own
at whatever post he is when he has a grown-up
daughter,&rdquo; smiled Helen. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better learn to
keep house right off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea thrilled Ethel. Never before had she
happened to think of the possibility of joining her
father after her school days were over. Never having
known any home except with Ethel Brown and
her other cousins she had always seen the future as
shared with them. The notion of leaving them was
painful, but the chance of being always with her father,
of being his housekeeper, of seeing him every
day, of making him comfortable, was one that filled
her with delight. Her blue eyes filled with tenderness
as she dreamed over the possibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lots to learn yet before I should know
enough,&rdquo; she murmured, staring almost unseeingly
at her cousin, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s wonderful to think I could
do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>The new idea would not leave her mind, though,
indeed, she made no effort to drive it out. That
the future might hold for her a change so complete
was something she wanted to let her thoughts linger
on. She hardly noticed that Roger was gathering
Dicky up into his arms to carry him upstairs to
bed, or that there was a general stir on the veranda,
betokening a move indoors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Graham was at Dorothy&rsquo;s this afternoon,&rdquo;
Ethel Brown said as she rose and picked up the
straw cushion on which she had been sitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she?&rdquo; inquired Helen interestedly. &ldquo;I
wish I had seen her. I never have yet, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither has Ethel Blue. She and Aunt Louise
and Dorothy and I went over to the new house and
looked at the attic. She says she&rsquo;ll come over next
week and help us about the bedroom floor. That
will be ready then for us to talk about the decorating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure and let me know when she is coming.
What did she say about the attic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She liked it especially because it had been
sheathed, following all the ins and outs. She
thought the irregularity was pretty. She suggested
a closet for furs over the kitchen. It won&rsquo;t cost
much to bring the refrigerating pipes up there, she
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bully. Aunt Louise may take care of
my fur gloves for me next summer if the moths
don&rsquo;t eat them up this year,&rdquo; promised Roger who
had stopped in the doorway to hear Ethel Brown&rsquo;s
report, and stood with the still sleeping Dicky over
his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She suggested a raised ledge about fourteen
inches high to stand trunks on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t break your back bending over
them when you&rsquo;re hunting for something,&rdquo; exclaimed
Helen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s splendid. She seems to have
practical ideas as well as ornamental ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She thought there ought to be a fire bucket closet
up there, too. You know Aunt Louise has had them
put in on all the other floors, but she didn&rsquo;t think
of it there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a narrow closet with four shelves. On
each of the lower three are fire buckets to be kept
full of water all the time and on the top shelf are
some of those hand grenade things and chemical
squirt guns. They don&rsquo;t look very well when
they&rsquo;re right out in sight. This way covers them
up but makes them just as convenient. There is to
be no lock on the door of the closet and FIRE is to
be painted outside so every one will know where
it is even if he gets rattled when the fire really happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the maids&rsquo; rooms to be on the attic floor?&rdquo;
asked Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two little beauties, and a bath-room between
them. One room is to be pink and the other blue
and they&rsquo;re going to have ivory paint and fluffy curtains
just like Dorothy&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think to say anything to Miss Graham
about the Club&rsquo;s using the attic in winter for weekly
meetings?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy did. She thought a movable platform
would be a great scheme; one wide enough for us
to use for a little stage when we wanted to have
singing or recitations up there. She picked out a
good place for the phonograph, where the shape of
the ceiling wouldn&rsquo;t make the sound queer, and
she thought rattan furniture stained brown would be
pretty, and scrim curtains&mdash;not dead white ones,
but a sort of goldeny cream that would harmonize
with the wood. There are lovely big cotton rugs in
dull blues, that aren&rsquo;t expensive, she says; and if
we don&rsquo;t want to see the row of trunks and chests
against the wall we can arrange screens that will
shut them out of sight and will also take the place
of the pictures that you can&rsquo;t hang on a wall that
slopes the wrong way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see, then, but Aunt Louise will have an
attic and we&rsquo;ll have a club room and both parties
to the transaction will be pleased,&rdquo; beamed Helen,
who, as president of the Club was always careful
that the members should be comfortable when they
gathered for their weekly talking and planning and
working.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t Miss Graham come from Washington?&rdquo;
asked Ethel Blue dreamily, half awakening to
the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you know she does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fort Myer is just across the river; I wonder if
she knows Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask her when you see her,&rdquo; recommended Ethel
Brown, and they all went in to bed as a clap of thunder
gave promise of a cooling shower.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI
<br />SPRING ALL THE YEAR ROUND</h2>
<p>It proved to be quite a week later before the
workmen were far enough along to make it
worth while for Miss Graham to be summoned to
a conference on the decoration of the bedroom floor,
and when Ethel Blue met her at last she forgot altogether
to ask if she knew her dearly beloved father.</p>
<p>There were several reasons why she did not ask.
In the first place she had forgotten that she meant
to; in the next, Miss Daisy was so absorbed in
what she was hearing from all the Club members
about their ideas for the bed-rooms, and so interested
in comparing them with her own practical knowledge
of how they could be carried out, that no one
who listened to her or saw her at work wanted to interrupt
her with any questions that had no bearing
on the matter in hand.</p>
<p>Not that she was not interested in the young people.
She was thoroughly interested in them. She
knew all of their names and sorted out one from
the other immediately just from Margaret&rsquo;s and
James&rsquo;s descriptions of them. She listened attentively
to their suggestions and they all felt that she
was treating their ideas with respect and that if she
did not always agree with them she had a good reason
for it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think she&rsquo;s the most competent woman almost
that I ever saw,&rdquo; said Helen admiringly to
Margaret as they stood at one side of the upper hall
and watched her as she rapidly sketched for Mrs.
Smith what she meant by a certain plan of window
hanging.</p>
<p>Helen was greatly interested in new occupations
for women and the fact that this woman had studied
to be an interior decorator and had succeeded so
well that she had orders from the suburbs of New
York itself had impressed the young girl as making
her well worth trying to know well. Helen was
not drawn toward interior decorating&mdash;she had already
made up her mind, that she was to be one of
the scientific home-makers educated at the School
of Mothercraft&mdash;but she admired women with the
courage to start new things, and this work seemed
to her to be perfectly suited to a woman and at
the same time of enough importance to be really
worth while putting a lot of preparation into it.
The dressing of shop windows seemed to her another
peculiarly feminine occupation, hardly entered
at all, as yet, by women, and capable of being developed
into an art.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The decoration of a room or a building ought
to seem a sort of growth from the room or the
building,&rdquo; Miss Graham was explaining to the
Ethels. &ldquo;It ought to seem perfectly natural that
it should be there, just as a blossom seems perfectly
natural to find on a plant. I never like the phrase
&lsquo;applied design,&rsquo;&rdquo; she continued, smiling as she
turned to Mrs. Smith. &ldquo;It sounds as if you made
a design and then clapped it on to the afflicted spot
as if it were a plaster of some kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too often it looks that way,&rdquo; Mrs. Smith smiled
in return. &ldquo;Come and see how we&rsquo;ve arranged our
sleeping porches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Miss Graham stood in the doorway that
opened on to the porch of Dorothy&rsquo;s room, one hand
resting on Ethel Brown&rsquo;s shoulder, Helen felt more
than ever the power&mdash;for friendliness and good
will as well as for the execution of her art&mdash;that
this dark-eyed, dark-haired, ruddy-cheeked young
woman possessed. Her nose was a trifle too short
for beauty and her mouth a bit too wide, but her
coloring denoted health, her hair curled crisply over
a broad forehead, her teeth were brilliantly white,
and the straight folds of her gown showed the lines
of her strong figure as the strange dull blue-green
of her linen frock, dashed with a bit of orange,
brought into relief all the good points of her tinting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She makes you want to stop and look at her,&rdquo;
Helen decided, &ldquo;and you want to know her, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith had arranged for three sleeping
porches, one for her own room, one for Dorothy&rsquo;s,
and a larger one outside of the nursery where the
Belgian baby enjoyed herself in the daytime. This
porch was also shared by Elisabeth&rsquo;s care-taker.
Each porch was on a different side of the house, so
that they did not encroach upon each other, and
each was somewhat different in arrangement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you originate this idea?&rdquo; asked Miss Graham,
as she examined the sliding windows by which
the bed was to be shut off from the room at night
and enclosed in the room in the morning. &ldquo;You
never need step out of bed on to the cold floor of
the porch,&rdquo; she commented approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw that in a sanitarium,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
Smith. &ldquo;It was desirable that the patients should
never be chilled and the doctor and architect invented
this way of preventing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s capital,&rdquo; smiled Miss Graham, &ldquo;and so
simple. When the inside sash is closed, the outside
is up, and vice versa. Are they all like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered her hostess. &ldquo;Dorothy is to
have a couch in that corner, and a table and chairs.
There is to be a screw eye attached to the foot of
the couch. A weight on the end of a cord will go
through a pulley fastened to the wall, high up over
the head of the couch. There will be a hook at the
other end of the cord. When this hook goes into
the screw eye and the weight is pulled, the couch will
stand on its head and will be out of the way at any
time when floor space is more to be desired than
lying down comfort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there will be some sort of drapery
to cover the under side when it is hauled up against
the wall,&rdquo; said Miss Graham with a question in her
voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy has something in mind that is going
to meet that difficulty, she thinks,&rdquo; answered Mrs.
Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to have your room of any decided
color,&rdquo; asked Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been perfectly crazy for a rose-colored
room, ever since I was a tiny child,&rdquo; answered
Dorothy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve set my heart on this room&rsquo;s looking
like a pink rose&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a bunch of apple blossoms?&rdquo; asked Miss
Graham.</p>
<p>Ethel Blue looked quickly at the decorator when
she made this suggestion which at once stirred the
young girl&rsquo;s imagination to a mental sight of a
springtime tree laden with clusters of blossoms,
whose delicate white was flushed with the delicate
pink of the dawn. The suggestion appealed to her
immediately as possible of a development far more
exquisite than that which Dorothy had planned.
Both would be pink, yet the fineness of the new color
scheme seemed to her suited to Dorothy&rsquo;s slender
grace. She could not have put it into words but
she felt that Miss Graham had a feeling for color
that enabled her to adapt the room in which the
color was to be used to the personality of the young
girl who was chiefly to use it. Instinctively she
moved closer to Miss Graham and met her smiling
glance with a nod and smile of understanding.</p>
<p>Dorothy liked the new idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think an apple-blossom room would be perfectly
lovely,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;If Mother would
only let me use wall-paper&mdash;I saw such a beauty
pattern the other day. There were clusters of apple-blossoms
all over it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to use wall-paper,&rdquo; Miss Graham
asked Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy and I decided that we would not use
wall-paper in the bed-rooms at any rate,&rdquo; answered
Dorothy&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we hadn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; pouted Dorothy, but she was
cheered when Miss Graham nodded her approval of
their decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Apart from
the sanitary side it isn&rsquo;t a good plan to paper walls
until the plaster is thoroughly dry. This is especially
true of a house built on the side of a hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This house has such a wonderful concrete foundation,&rdquo;
said Margaret, &ldquo;that I should think it
would be always perfectly solid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So should I,&rdquo; answered Miss Graham, &ldquo;but
there&rsquo;s always a chance that some part of the soil
beneath may give a little when the full weight of a
house rests upon it. The settling of a house for
only a half inch or an inch would play havoc with the
plaster on these walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think we&rsquo;d better hold back the paper for
a final resort?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never advise paper in bed-rooms unless
there&rsquo;s good reason to do so,&rdquo; answered the decorator.
&ldquo;Here is what I should suggest for an apple-blossom
room&mdash;though perhaps you have some
ideas that you would like to have carried out?&rdquo; she
interrupted herself to ask Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dorothy, &ldquo;as long as it&rsquo;s pink and
pretty I don&rsquo;t care how it is decorated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Graham stood in the centre of the room
now, noticing how the sunshine fell on the floor, the
shadow at the end where the sleeping porch was, and
the possible positions for the various articles of
furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seem to see these walls washed with a white
which is tinted with a faint flush of pink,&rdquo; said Miss
Graham slowly, as she thought it out. &ldquo;That
means a pink so delicate that it will not irritate the
weariest nerves and will soothe to sleep by its
beauty. The wood-work should be similar in tone
but a trifle more like ivory. Do you know that
chintz that has blurry, indefinite flowers on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy said that she did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a lovely piece of it the other day with
a design of apple-blossoms. I should use that as
a covering for your bed, your couch, your chairs,
and for hangings for the windows. Then across
one end of the wall&mdash;on that shadiest side,&mdash;I
should throw a branch of apple-blossoms, painted in
the same blurry, indefinite way in which the flowers
appear on the chintz. I knew a man who was
enough of the artist in his soul to do the thing as
if the wall had suddenly grown thin and through it
you could see an apple tree in blossom out in the
orchard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that would be perfectly lovely,&rdquo; said
Dorothy, and all the others expressed the greatest
pleasure at the proposed scheme of decoration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here is what I would suggest for the windows,&rdquo;
said Miss Daisy, taking out her note book,
and sketching with a few rapid lines the folds of
apple-blossom chintz, falling straight at the sides,
with a valance at the top showing a very slight fullness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between these and the windows,&rdquo; said Miss
Graham, &ldquo;I should put Swiss muslin, either perfectly
plain or dotted or with a fine cross-bar, whichever
you like best. I should have those muslin curtains
next to the glass all alike all over the house and
the shades, too, so that the effect from the outside
will be uniform and not messy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That neatness will suit Ethel Brown&rsquo;s ideas of
what is harmonious,&rdquo; laughed Helen, and Miss Graham
flashed her brilliant smile on Ethel Brown,
who was nodding her approval of the idea as she
listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, how had you planned to finish the other
sleeping porches?&rdquo; inquired Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought we&rsquo;d better have a radiator on the
one leading off the nursery,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to be awfully careful about its freezing,&rdquo;
warned Miss Graham.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we shall, but it seemed as if it might
be advisable with a child who has been so delicate
as Elisabeth. You will see that the outer ledge of
her porch is somewhat higher than either Dorothy&rsquo;s
or mine and there are pieces of lattice work to fill
in the openings on very cold nights. We thought
we&rsquo;d have out there a low play-table for the baby,
and one or two little chairs and a work-table and
easy-chair for Miss Merriam.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p10.png" alt="A Play-table for the Baby" width="463" height="174" />
<p>A Play-table for the Baby</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are cotton Chinese rugs that are extremely
pretty for upstairs porches,&rdquo; said Miss Graham.
&ldquo;One that is largely white but has a dash
of green and pink, would be charming for Dorothy&rsquo;s
porch. What color is the baby&rsquo;s room to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethel Blue wants us to have it pale blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again a vivid look of appreciation came into
Miss Graham&rsquo;s eyes as she turned them on Ethel
Blue, but she merely said, &ldquo;There are charming
Chinese rugs in white with dull blue designs like old
Chinese pottery. Tell me what you had planned in
your mind for Elisabeth,&rdquo; she continued, turning toward
the young girl and extending her hand so winningly
that Ethel found herself not only standing beside
her with a feeling that she had been her friend
for a long time, but filled with confidence that her
suggestions would not be laughed at, and might indeed
be really good.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought of walls and paint of white faintly
colored with blue. It was just about what you suggested
for Dorothy&rsquo;s room, only blue instead of
pink; and it seemed to me that there might be blue
birds&mdash;for happiness, you know&mdash;skimming along
the walls, up near the top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of those big Chinese rugs that is almost
all white, but has a little blue, would be lovely,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; cried Helen, seizing the idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several small ones would be better,&rdquo; returned
Miss Graham, &ldquo;because a baby&rsquo;s room has to be
kept so spick and span that you want to have light
rugs that are easy to take up and clean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know those little round seats that you
sometimes see in railway waiting rooms?&rdquo; asked
Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>Miss Graham said she had noticed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think one would be cunning for Elisabeth?
The seat part ought to be awfully low and
there could be light blue cushions on it. And then
I think it would be fun if there was a low bench
running around two sides of the room, with cushions
of the same color on it. It would do for a table
and a seat both.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">

<p>&ldquo;There could be light blue cushions on the seat&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Miss Graham thought the idea was capital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you paint them?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t a sort of bluish-white like the wood-work
be pretty,&rdquo; asked Ethel Blue. &ldquo;You know
that shiny paint that is so highly polished that the
baby&rsquo;s finger marks won&rsquo;t show on it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p12.png" alt="Ayleesabet&rsquo;s Goldfish" width="631" height="353" />
<p>Ayleesabet&rsquo;s Goldfish</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Enamel paint,&rdquo; translated Miss Graham. &ldquo;I
think it would be very pretty, and I should have all
the little chairs and tables painted the same way.
There are a lot of little things that would be charming
in the nursery,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;You can have
a solid table, whose top lifts off, disclosing a sand-pile
inside. And some parts of that seat around
the room ought to lift up so that the baby can put
away her own toys in the box underneath the cushions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought a great big doll&rsquo;s house might fit into
one corner so that it would be two-sided,&rdquo; said Ethel
Blue. &ldquo;If the lower floor was all one room the
baby could walk right in and sit down with the
dolls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she could keep still long enough to
make a real visit?&rdquo; laughed Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want to interest her in plants and animals
as she grows up,&rdquo; suggested Miss Graham.
&ldquo;You might begin even now by having an aquarium
with a few water plants and some gold fish and you
must arrange to have it on a good solid stand so
that it won&rsquo;t tip over if Elisabeth should happen to
throw her fat little self against it. I suppose she&rsquo;s
too small to have had any regular training as yet?&rdquo;
she continued, turning to Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Merriam, who is taking care of her, is
trying some of the Montessori ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps she was. Madame Montessori
tries to make all her training a natural outcome
of the children&rsquo;s lives and to develop them to use
what they know in their daily occupations. If
Elisabeth had a clothes-closet small enough for her
to hang up and take down her own dresses and
coats and rompers, I think Miss Merriam would
find that she would be trying to put them on and
fasten them herself very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t a clothes pole about three feet high
be too cunning for words,&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel Blue,
and Dorothy cried, &ldquo;Do let us have all these things,
Mother. Elisabeth will look like a little white
Persian kitten, trotting around in this blue and white
room!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Had you made any plans for your own room,
Mrs. Smith?&rdquo; asked Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Louise, I do wish you&rsquo;d have one of
those gray rooms, with scarlet lacquer furniture,&rdquo;
cried Helen eagerly.</p>
<p>Before Mrs. Smith could answer, Miss Graham
had interposed a soft objection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;A room like that has
several reasons for non-existence. They are very
handsome because the real scarlet lacquer is beautiful
in itself, and it&rsquo;s valuable too, but a room whose
chief appeal to the eye is scarlet is not restful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think scarlet is not a proper color for a
bed-room,&rdquo; responded Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all suitable to my way of thinking. It&rsquo;s
exciting, rather than soothing. Another objection
to it here is that a room containing such a vivid
color should be a dark room, and all of your bed-rooms
are splendidly light. But the most serious
objection to my mind, is this. Just step out here in
the entry with me for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all followed Miss Graham on to the landing
at the head of the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a house as small as this,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you
can see from the hall into all the bed-rooms. That
means that from the decorator&rsquo;s point of view, the
entire floor ought to be harmonious. Behind us,
for instance, is the baby&rsquo;s delicate blue nursery.
Just ahead is Dorothy&rsquo;s apple-blossom room. Do
you think that a room of gray and scarlet and black
is going to be harmonious with those delicate tints?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>They saw her meaning at once and agreed with
her that it would not be suitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decorated a small apartment last winter,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;that turned out very happily. The sitting
room was one of these scarlet lacquer rooms and
the bed-room was done in tones of pale green and
dull orange. You felt as if you were sitting in an
orange grove in Florida on an evening when a frost
was expected and they were burning smudges to
warm the trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; cried Dorothy, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen them do
that. You see the oranges gleaming through the
misty smoke, and it&rsquo;s all hazy and beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It turned out well in this room that I did,&rdquo; said
Miss Graham, modestly, &ldquo;but if you accept the
blue and pink colorings for the other rooms here,&rdquo;
she said, turning to Mrs. Smith with a smile, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid your own room will have to be of some delicate
tone to harmonize with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are certain shades of yellow, that would
be suitable,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A primrose yellow,&rdquo; answered Miss Graham,
&ldquo;would be charming, and it would not be hard to
find a lovely chintz, that would give you just the
spring-like atmosphere that you&rsquo;d enjoy having about
you all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re going to have this floor a little
piece of spring all the year around,&rdquo; said Ethel
Blue; and again Miss Graham flashed at her a look
of understanding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII
<br />CLOSETS AND STEPMOTHERS</h2>
<p>After they had shown all the rest of the house
to Miss Daisy the family party gathered on
the brick terrace outside of the drawing room to investigate
lemonade and little cakes. The Ethels
had brought the lemonade from home in a thermos
bottle which kept it cool and refreshing, and that
morning Dorothy had made some &ldquo;hearts and
rounds&rdquo; which proved most appetizing with the cool
drink.</p>
<p>A few canvas chairs which Mrs. Smith had sent
over from home, so that she might have something
to sit down on when she visited the new house, were
all the furniture of the veranda, but the girls found
several boxes which the workmen had left, and they
laid planks on them and made benches that were entirely
comfortable. A similar arrangement with
the boxes turned on their ends provided a little table
on which they placed the refreshments. Paper cups
answered every necessary purpose, although they
were not beautiful, and paper plates held the hearts
and rounds just as well as if they had been china.</p>
<p>They were all a little tired after walking about
the house for so long a time, and those of them
who had chairs leaned back with satisfaction and
looked over the low parapet to the adjoining
meadow with its brook and its cluster of woods at
the upper end. Beyond the fields the Emersons&rsquo;
house could be seen dimly through the trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We wondered in the springtime whether we
should be able to see this house from Grandfather&rsquo;s
house,&rdquo; said Ethel Brown. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t looked
lately, but I guess we can, or else we shouldn&rsquo;t be
able to see Grandfather&rsquo;s house from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The line of those far-away mountains is very
beautiful against the sky,&rdquo; Miss Graham noticed,
with her keen observation of everything that added
to the loveliness of the landscape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are far enough away to have a blue haze
hanging over them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith, &ldquo;and they
give you a feeling that our quiet country scene here
has a great deal of variety after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your house is admirably placed to make the
most of every beauty around you,&rdquo; said Miss Daisy,
&ldquo;and I hope you&rsquo;ll allow me to compliment you on
the way it is turning out. You know they say that
you have to build two or three houses in order to
build one exactly to your satisfaction, but I should
think that you were almost accomplishing that with
your first attempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you like so many things about it,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Smith. &ldquo;Dorothy and I would be pleased
with almost any house that really belonged to us, for
we&rsquo;ve had nothing of our own for many years, but
of course it is a tremendous satisfaction to have this
develop into something that is beautiful and livable
too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve added so many happy touches,&rdquo; said
Miss Graham. &ldquo;Take for instance this terrace. A
brick terrace always makes me think of some old
country house in England, with its dark red walls
buried among the brilliant green foliage. So many
of those houses have terraces like this, partly roofed
like yours, and wide enough to be really an extra
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Louise&rsquo;s terrace is really two extra rooms,&rdquo;
said Ethel Blue, &ldquo;because it opens from the drawing
room and also from the dining room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to have all our meals out here in
pleasant weather, whenever it&rsquo;s warm enough,&rdquo; said
Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see you&rsquo;re sufficiently afraid of New Jersey
mosquitoes to have a part screened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only prudent thing to do,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
Smith. &ldquo;Jersey mosquitoes are really more than a
joke, but if you have this wire cage to get into you
can defy them. You can see that at the end of the
terrace opposite the dining room our cage covers the
whole of the floor, while up at this end only a part is
wired in. In the evening when the buzzers are buzzing
we can take shelter behind the screen, but in the
daytime we can sit outside as we&rsquo;re doing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to glass it in winter? I see you
have a radiator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are to be long glass sashes that fit into
the same grooves that hold the screens now. The
open fire will take off the chill on autumn mornings
and the radiator ought to keep us warm even when
the snow is banked against the glass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;With palms and rubber plants and rugs and
wicker chairs and tables&mdash;I suppose you&rsquo;ll have
wicker?&rdquo; Mrs. Morton interrupted herself to inquire
of her sister-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, wicker, but we haven&rsquo;t decided between
brown or green,&rdquo; and Mrs. Smith turned appealingly
to Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither, I should say. Don&rsquo;t you think a dull
dark red, a mahogany red&mdash;would be pretty with
this brick floor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And against the concrete wall. I do; and it
ought not to be hard to find rugs with dull reds and
greens that will draw all those earthy, autumnal
shades together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have one of those swinging settees
hanging by chains from the ceiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy would enjoy that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would we,&rdquo; interposed Ethel Brown. &ldquo;I
seem to see myself perching on it, waving my lemonade
cup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t illustrate all over me,&rdquo; remonstrated
Ethel Blue, dodging the flowing bowl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like very much the seclusion you&rsquo;ve gained by
building up the wall at the end of the terrace on the
side toward the road,&rdquo; said Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found that people could see from the road
any one sitting on the terrace, although we&rsquo;re so
high here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith, &ldquo;but with the parapet
built up at that end, they can&rsquo;t see anything, even
though there is an opening in the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the window frames a lovely picture of the
meadows across the road from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; said Ethel Brown, &ldquo;why you always
call your living room a drawing room, Aunt
Louise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a living room,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Smith.
&ldquo;A living room is really a room which is used both
as a sitting room and a dining room. No room
which is used for only one of those purposes should
be called a living room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of people do,&rdquo; insisted Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are not right,&rdquo; returned her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drawing room seems a very formal name for
it,&rdquo; Helen said. &ldquo;Of course we&rsquo;re used to it, because
Grandmother Emerson always calls her parlor
a drawing room, but she has a huge, big room, so
my idea of a drawing room is always something immense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is rather old-fashioned and stately,&rdquo;
admitted Mrs. Smith; &ldquo;but the drawing room is
simply a place where the family <i>withdraws</i> to sit together
and talk together, and it need not be any more
formal than the people who use it. But I protest
that my drawing room or sitting room, or whatever
it may be, shall not be called a living room, because
it is not devoted to eating as well as sitting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you make that distinction,&rdquo; said Miss
Graham. &ldquo;So many people are careless about using
the word and nowadays you seldom find a real living
room except in a bungalow in the country where people
are living very informally during the summer, and
where space is limited. There&rsquo;s another thing about
your house that I like exceedingly,&rdquo; she continued,
&ldquo;and that is your closets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton, who had joined the party on the
terrace, laughed heartily at this praise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ought to please you, Louise,&rdquo; she said,
and added, turning to Miss Graham, &ldquo;Louise has
spent more time inventing all sorts of cupboards and
closets than in drawing the original plan of the
house, I really believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it wasn&rsquo;t wasted time,&rdquo; returned Miss
Graham. &ldquo;I have every sympathy with a craze for
closets. You can&rsquo;t have too many to suit me. Do
you remember that room at Mt. Vernon entirely surrounded
by cupboards and closets? I always thought
Washington must have had an extraordinarily orderly
mind to want to have all his dining room belongings
carefully placed on shelves behind closed
doors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how many different kinds of closets we
have,&rdquo; murmured Dorothy, beginning to count them
up on her fingers. Everybody tossed in a contribution,
naming the closet which she happened to remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A coat closet near the front door,&rdquo; said Ethel
Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clothes closets in every bed-room and two extra
ones in the attic,&rdquo; added Mrs. Smith.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A dress closet with mirrors on the doors, that
turn back to make a three-fold dressing glass. I
envy you that comfort, Louise,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll notice that the coat closets and the clothes
closets all have long poles with countless hangers on
them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll hold a tremendous
number of garments; many more than Dorothy
and I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The closet I&rsquo;m craziest about is the one that is
filled with glass cubes to put hats in,&rdquo; said Helen.
&ldquo;You open the door and there are half a dozen, and
you can see the hats right through, so you don&rsquo;t have
to keep pulling out one box after another, always getting
the wrong one first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a perfectly splendid idea,&rdquo; approved Miss
Graham. &ldquo;I suppose along the lower part of the
closet side of your room, you have small closets and
cupboards for shoes and for blouses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my blouse closet above my shoe closet,&rdquo;
returned Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice the tall, thin closet for one-piece
dresses?&rdquo; asked Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think that would be splendid because it
doesn&rsquo;t jam up your evening dresses,&rdquo; said Helen,
who was beginning to think longingly of real,
grown-up evening dresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the closet Ethel Blue always calls the
&lsquo;stepmother closet,&rsquo;&rdquo; laughed Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why &lsquo;stepmother closet&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired Miss Graham
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it would pinch a stepmother so hard if
she got into it,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>Miss Graham looked puzzled and Dorothy explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethel Blue hates stepmothers. She doesn&rsquo;t
know why, except that they are always horrid in fairy
stories, but she thinks this long narrow closet would
be just the place to put a horrid one into to punish
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stepmothers are often very nice,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a stepmother,&rdquo; said Miss Graham, &ldquo;and
I couldn&rsquo;t have loved my own mother more tenderly,
and I&rsquo;m sure she loved Margaret&rsquo;s mother and me
quite as well as if we had been her own children. In
fact, I think she was more careful of us than she was
of her own children. She used to say we were a
legacy to her and that she felt it her duty as well as
her delight to be extra good to us, for our mother&rsquo;s
sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel Blue listened and smiled at the kind brown
eyes that were smiling at her, but she shook her head
as if she were unconvinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate you might select your closet to fit
your stepmother,&rdquo; Miss Daisy laughed, &ldquo;and if you
wanted to be very bad to a thin one, you could make
her squeeze up small in one of the glass hat boxes,
and a fat one would suffer most in this narrow closet
of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed again and went on with the list
of closets in the house.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You noticed, I hope,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith, &ldquo;that almost
every closet in the house has an electric bulb inside
that lights when you open the door and goes out
again when the door is closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendid,&rdquo; approved Miss Graham. &ldquo;Is there
one in your linen closet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. Did you notice that the linen
closet is on the bedroom floor? There need be no
carrying up and down stairs of heavy bed linen.
The linen for the maid&rsquo;s room, in the attic, is kept in
a small linen closet up there, and the table linen belongs
in a closet made especially for it in the dining
room. It has many glass shelves quite close together,
so that each table cloth may have a spot to itself
and the centrepieces and doilies may be kept flat
with nothing to rumple them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the medicine closets will go into the
bath-rooms when the other fittings are installed,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned her sister-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice the pretty cedar shavings that the
carpenters left on the floor of the cedar closet?&rdquo;
asked Dorothy. &ldquo;They say they always leave the
cedar shavings they made, because people like to
put them among their clothes to make them fragrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you are having a cedar closet,&rdquo; said
Margaret. &ldquo;Mother got along with a cedar chest
for a great many years, but she has always longed
for a cedar closet. She had one built this summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have both,&rdquo; said Dorothy. &ldquo;The chest is
going up in the attic and the closet is on the bedroom
floor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The thing that pleases me most in the closet
line,&rdquo; said Ethel Brown, who is a good cook,
&ldquo;is the pastry closet just off the kitchen. The
carpenter told me there was a refrigerating pipe running
around it so that it would always be cool, and
there was to be a plate glass shelf on which the
pastry could be rolled out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly have the latest wrinkles,&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Morton admiringly. &ldquo;I have never
seen that arrangement in real life. I thought it only
existed in large hotels or the women&rsquo;s magazines!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are lots of other little comforts in our
house,&rdquo; laughed Dorothy, &ldquo;and there are two or
three more kinds of closets if we count bookcases
that have doors and cupboards to keep games in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re every one modern and useful except that
stepmother squeezer,&rdquo; said Miss Graham, rising to
take leave. &ldquo;That sounds like some invention of
the Middle Ages when people used to torture each
other to death so cheerfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I wouldn&rsquo;t <i>torture</i> her,&rdquo; protested Ethel
Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless she were a really truly fairy story bad
one,&rdquo; Miss Daisy insisted. &ldquo;Could you resist
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held Ethel Blue&rsquo;s eyes for just a second with
her smiling gaze that was graven down in the depths
of her warm brown ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t <i>really</i> hurt her,&rdquo; Ethel Blue repeated,
and wondered why she felt as if she had been taken
seriously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII
<br />&ldquo;OFF TO PHILADELPHIA IN THE MORNING&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo; called Mrs. Morton a few days
later just after the morning visit of the letter
carrier, &ldquo;I have a note here from Uncle Richard
asking me if I can run over to Philadelphia and attend
to a little matter of business for him. He is so
tied up at Fort Myer that he can&rsquo;t possibly get away.
Do you think it would be pleasant if you and I went
over for a few days and took Roger and the children
with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;children&rdquo; of the Morton family meant
those younger than Roger and Helen. Helen received
the suggestion with a cry of delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be just too lovely for anything,&rdquo; she
said, waving in the air the little linen dress she was
making for Elisabeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The younger girls had the Massachusetts trip
this summer that you and Roger didn&rsquo;t share,&rdquo; her
mother said. &ldquo;I think this time we might all of
us go, and I&rsquo;m not sure that it would not be pleasant
to ask the Watkinses and the Hancocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.!&rdquo; cried Helen. &ldquo;Mother,
you certainly were born a darling. How did you
ever think of anything so perfectly galoptious?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s natural for me to be &lsquo;galoptious,&rsquo;&rdquo; her
mother returned, laughing. &ldquo;Now, we shall have
to work fast, if we are going to accomplish Uncle
Richard&rsquo;s errand, because the people whom he wants
me to see will be in Philadelphia only to-morrow.
He has telegraphed them, asking them to keep an
hour for me, so I must go over to-day or very early
to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to have me call up Margaret and
Della on the telephone and see if they can go to-day?
If they can, I don&rsquo;t see why we can&rsquo;t fly around
tremendously and get our bags packed this morning
and take an afternoon train,&rdquo; said Helen, who was
beginning to grow energetic as the full prospect of
the pleasure before her appeared before the eyes of
her mind.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton agreeing, Helen flew to the telephone,
and was lucky enough to catch Margaret at
Glen Point and Della in New York without any difficulty.
They both said that they would consult their
mothers and would call Helen again within an
hour. She then telephoned to Dorothy, but found
that she was at Sweetbrier Lodge and as the telephone
had not been put in yet, she was, for a moment,
at a loss what to do. She remembered, however,
that Ethel Brown and Ethel Blue had spoken of
spending the morning at Grandmother Emerson&rsquo;s,
and she therefore called up her house in the hope that
they might be there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>They had just left there to go and do a little house-cleaning
in the cave in Fitzjames&rsquo; woods, where they
frequently enjoyed an afternoon lemonade. Mrs.
Emerson said, however, that she could easily send a
messenger after them, and that it would not be many
minutes before she would ring Helen in her turn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t anything to report,&rdquo; Helen said to her
mother after she had made these various calls, &ldquo;but
I had better be getting out our handbags and trying
to find Roger, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton was already packing her valise with
her own and Dicky&rsquo;s requirements and she nodded an
assent to Helen&rsquo;s suggestion.</p>
<p>It was not many minutes before the telephone bell
began ringing. The first summons was from Margaret
Hancock who said that her mother and father
were delighted with the opportunity to have her and
James go to Philadelphia in Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a real Club expedition,&rdquo; she said gleefully,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m just as sure as if I saw it with my own
eyes, that you&rsquo;re packing a &lsquo;History of Philadelphia&rsquo;
in your hand-bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen laughed because she was well accustomed to
being joked about her love of history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I notice all of you are willing enough to listen
when I tell about places,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and this time
you&rsquo;ll have to take it from me because Grandfather
won&rsquo;t be there to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next ring meant that the Ethels had returned
to Mrs. Emerson&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want of us?&rdquo; Ethel Blue asked in
a tone that sounded as if she were not particularly
pleased at being called back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How would you like to go to Philadelphia?&rdquo;
Helen answered triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really mean it?&rdquo; asked Ethel, who was
not quite sure that her ears were hearing correctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do mean it, and if you and Ethel Blue want to
go with Mother and me this afternoon, you must
rush home just as fast as you can and get your bags
packed. Aunt Louise says Dorothy may go, but I
can&rsquo;t find her, so please stop at the new house and see
if she&rsquo;s there and tell her about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well I should say we would,&rdquo; returned a voice
that was now filled with delight. &ldquo;Ethel Blue
wants to know why Mother is going?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On some business for her father&mdash;for Uncle
Richard. But do stop chattering and come home as
fast as you can rush. If we don&rsquo;t get off this afternoon,
we can&rsquo;t go until to-morrow morning and we
shan&rsquo;t be able to stay so long in Philadelphia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not until they reached home that the Ethels
learned that the Watkinses and the Hancocks were to
join the party, and they were so excited over the prospect
of this Club pilgrimage, that they were hardly
able to get together their belongings.</p>
<p>The most difficult person to find was Roger who
did not seem to be within reach of the telephone anywhere.
They called up all the places where they
thought it possible that he might be, but he could not
be found, and he walked in just before luncheon quite
unprepared for the surprise that awaited him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Helen has packed your bag for you,&rdquo; his mother
told him, &ldquo;so rush and change your clothes and go to
the train to meet Della and Tom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosemont being already part way on the road
from New York and Philadelphia, it was necessary
for the party to take a local train to the nearest stopping
place of the Express. The Watkinses came
out from New York on a local and the Hancocks arrived
on the trolley, so that the entire group met at
the Mortons&rsquo; about half an hour before the time to
start. They were all chattering briskly, all filled
with enthusiasm for this new adventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;d better go too?&rdquo; Mr. Emerson
asked his daughter, as he counted up the throng
and noticed their eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s necessary, Father,&rdquo; Mrs. Morton
replied. &ldquo;Roger and Tom and James are surely
big enough to escort us, and I know Philadelphia so
well that I have no fear of our being lost in the city
with three such competent young men to take care of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Emerson smiled somewhat doubtfully and
murmured something about his daughter&rsquo;s having a
hopeful disposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t realize how serious Roger can be
when he feels that he has actual responsibility,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Morton, &ldquo;and as for James Hancock, he is
sometimes so grave that he almost alarms me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be grave, but has he any sense?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Emerson tartly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The children seem to think he has a great deal.
At any rate I feel sure that no difficulty is going to
come to us with these three big boys on hand and I
wouldn&rsquo;t think of taking you on this fatiguing trip,
on such a hot day,&rdquo; insisted his daughter.</p>
<p>Mr. Emerson looked somewhat relieved although
he again assured Mrs. Morton that he would be entirely
willing to escort her and her flock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No farther than the Rosemont station, thank
you,&rdquo; she said, smiling.</p>
<p>It was at the station and just as the train was drawing
in that Mr. Emerson handed Helen a notebook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve taken me by surprise this morning,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and I haven&rsquo;t had much time to get up my
usual collection of historical poetry, but I couldn&rsquo;t
let you go off without having something of the kind
to remember me by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen and the Ethels laughed at this confession,
for Mr. Emerson was so fond of American history
that he was in the habit, whenever they all went on
trips together, of supplying himself with ballads concerning
any historical happenings in the district
through which they were to travel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Philadelphia ought to be a fertile field for you,
sir,&rdquo; said James Hancock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; returned the old gentleman, &ldquo;but you&rsquo;ll
escape the full force of my efforts this time, thanks
to your quick start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The run to the junction and then to Philadelphia
was made in a short time. It was fairly familiar to
all of them and the country presented no beauties to
make it remarkable, although Roger pretended to be
a guide showing wonderful sights to the New
Yorkers, Della and Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think, Mother, we shall have time to
look up some of the historical places in the city?&rdquo;
asked Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that would be the most interesting
thing to do,&rdquo; Mrs. Morton replied. &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t have
to meet my business people until midday to-morrow,
so this afternoon and to-morrow morning we can see
many points of interest if we don&rsquo;t delay too long at
each one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being related to the Navy through my paternal
ancestor,&rdquo; said Roger in large language, &ldquo;Philadelphia
has always interested me because the father
of old William Penn, its founder, was an Admiral in
the English Navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch me run for base!&rdquo; exclaimed Roger.
&ldquo;I got one off of Helen on the first ball. It isn&rsquo;t
often that Helen admits there&rsquo;s something she
doesn&rsquo;t know about American history.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You miserable boy! You sound as if I were
pretending to be a &lsquo;know-it-all&rsquo;! There are plenty
of things I don&rsquo;t know about American history. For
instance I know very little about William Penn, except
that he was a Quaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Roger, &ldquo;allow me to inform
you, beloved sister, that William Penn was an Oxford
man and a preacher in the Society of Friends. He
seems to have had some pull because the powers gave
him a grant of Pennsylvania (that means Penn&rsquo;s
Woods), in 1680. He went to America two years
later and founded this minute little town which we
are approaching.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those old Englishmen on the other side certainly
had a calm way of giving out grants of land
without saying anything about it to the Indians,
didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; said Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penn got along much better with the Indians
than many of the heads of the colonies. He made
a treaty with them, which is said to have been very
remarkable in two ways; in the first place he wouldn&rsquo;t
swear to keep it because he was a Quaker, and
Quakers won&rsquo;t take an oath; and in the next place, he
<i>did</i> keep it, which was quite an event in colonial
circles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have been a good chap,&rdquo; commented
Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to see a statue of him as soon as
you get off the train,&rdquo; interposed Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; asked Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On top of the City Hall. It&rsquo;s the first thing you
see when you come out of the railroad station. In
fact you&rsquo;re so close to the Public Buildings, as they&rsquo;re
called, that I doubt if you can see the top at all until
you get farther away from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The statue must be enormous if it&rsquo;s up so high,&rdquo;
said Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been told it was thirty-seven feet high,&rdquo; returned
Mrs. Morton, &ldquo;and that the rim of the old
gentleman&rsquo;s hat was so wide that a person could walk
on it comfortably.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be fun to do our back step on the
edge of his hat!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel Blue to Ethel
Brown, as they looked out the cab which was taking
them to the hotel, and saw the figure of the benevolent
Quaker black against the sky some five hundred
feet above the ground.</p>
<p>The hotel wherein Mrs. Morton established her
flock was &ldquo;in the heart of conservative Philadelphia.&rdquo;
Immediately after luncheon they packed
themselves into a large touring car and began their
historical explorations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do things according to time, we ought to
go first to all of the places that have to do with William
Penn,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid that might make us jump around the
city a little,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton, &ldquo;because if I am not
mistaken, the house that William Penn gave to his
daughter Letitia, is out in Fairmount Park, and the
one belonging to his grandson is in the Zoo. We&rsquo;ll
see them before we go home, but now we had better
give our attention to the things that are here in the
city. To begin with we can go to the little park on
whose site William Penn made his famous treaty
with the Indians. It takes us somewhat out of our
way, but I know Helen&rsquo;s orderly mind will like to begin
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>Helen smiled at her mother&rsquo;s understanding of
her, and the car sped northwards along the river
front, now given over to business and tenements.
At the Treaty Park they looked about them with their
imaginations rather than with their eyes, for there
was little of interest before them, while the Past held
a vision of the elm tree under which the group of
broad-hatted Friends discussed terms with the copper-colored
natives. Lieutenant Morton&rsquo;s children
were interested in seeing not far away the ship building
yards where many an American battleship had
slipped from the ways to pursue her peaceful course
upon the ocean.</p>
<p>Returning as they had come, they passed on Second
Street the site of a house in which the Great Settler
had lived, and promised themselves to remember
that in Independence Hall they were to look for
a piece of the Treaty Tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything that isn&rsquo;t called &lsquo;Penn&rsquo; in this town
seems to be called &lsquo;Franklin,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Ethel Blue,
after reading many of the signs on the buildings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because the great Benjamin lived here for
most of his life,&rdquo; said James, by way of explanation.
&ldquo;He was born in Boston, but he soon deserted those
cold regions for a warmer clime, and made a name
for himself here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say he left it behind him,&rdquo; commented
Ethel Blue again as she read another sign, this time
of a &ldquo;Penn Laundry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Penn and Franklin are the two great men of old
Philadelphia, without any doubt,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton,
as the machine stopped before Carpenters&rsquo; Hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; cried Tom. &ldquo;I blush to state
that I don&rsquo;t know Carpenters&rsquo; Hall from a ham
sandwich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen looked at him with horror on her face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Stand right here before we set foot inside and
let me tell you that I am perfectly shocked that any
American boy, old enough to have graduated from
high school and to be going to Yale in a few weeks,
should make such a statement as that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was genuinely troubled about it and Tom
flushed as he saw that she really was scornful of his
ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, next,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do you know what the
Boston Tea Party was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom meekly said that he remembered that in
December, 1773, a number of Boston men disguised
as Indians had thrown overboard from a ship in the
harbor, boxes of tea on which they refused to pay
the British duty.</p>
<p>Helen nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you remember that much,&rdquo; she said
tartly. &ldquo;After that Tea Party there was a continual
and rapid growth of dislike for the Old Country,
which was trying to tax the colonists, without
allowing them any representation in the Parliament
which was governing them. The feeling grew so
strong that a Continental Congress, made up of delegates
from the thirteen original Colonies, was called
to meet here in Philadelphia, in September, 1774.
It met here at Carpenters&rsquo; Hall,&rdquo; she concluded triumphantly.</p>
<p>Tom glanced up at the Hall with an entirely new
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this same old building?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In this very identical place,&rdquo; said Helen, and
then she allowed the procession to enter the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;September 17, 1774,&rdquo; repeated Ethel Brown
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Why, that was the autumn before
the battles of Concord and Lexington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Revolution had not yet begun. The
Continental Congress met to talk over the situation,
and here are the very chairs the members used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel Blue touched one of them with the tips of
her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve touched anything as interesting as
this,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the inscription,&rdquo; said James, calling their
attention to the lettering. &ldquo;<span class="small">WITHIN THESE WALLS
HENRY, HANCOCK AND ADAMS INSPIRED THE DELEGATES
OF THE COLONIES WITH NERVE AND SINEW
FOR THE TOILS OF WAR!</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Hancock was my great-great-grandfather&rsquo;s
brother,&rdquo; said James proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you, old chap,&rdquo; exclaimed Roger,
thumping him on the back, while Helen beamed at
Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long did these Congressmen chat here?&rdquo;
meekly asked Tom of Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After about a month they agreed on what they
called a Declaration of Rights, and they sent it over
to Franklin, who was in England, and asked him to
present it to the House of Commons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the light of after events I suppose the House
of Commons didn&rsquo;t take a look at it,&rdquo; said Roger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They certainly did not,&rdquo; replied Helen, &ldquo;and
the battles of Lexington and Concord were the result.
You remember they were fought in April of 1775.
Ticonderoga was captured in May of the same year
and the battle of Bunker Hill was fought in June.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Congress kept on sitting while all this fighting
was going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the men discussed each new move as it was
made. Early in June one of the members made a
motion before the Congress that &lsquo;these Colonies
ought to be Independent.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That idea seems simple enough to us now,&rdquo; said
Tom, &ldquo;but I dare say it was startling when a mere
colonist proposed to break off with the mother country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me it&rsquo;s about time for Grandfather
Emerson to have some poetry on this period of history,&rdquo;
said Ethel Brown. &ldquo;If he were here, I&rsquo;m
sure he would never have let this Congress sit for
eight or nine months without discovering something
in poetry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly understand Grandfather,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;In just about a minute, while we&rsquo;re going
over to Independence Hall, I&rsquo;m going to read you
some verses that belong right in here. On the first
of July they began to debate about this proposal that
the colonists should be independent. It was a
mighty important matter, of course, because if they
adopted it, it certainly meant war, and if they did not
beat in the war, it might mean a worse state of affairs
than they were in at the present moment. So
there was much to be said on both sides and it looked
as if the vote was going to be very close. Here&rsquo;s
where Rodney the delegate did some hard riding,&rdquo;
and Helen took out one of the type-written sheets,
which her grandfather had given her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What Colony did he represent?&rdquo; asked Ethel
Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rodney was from Delaware,&rdquo; she returned,
&ldquo;Now listen, while I read you this poem.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty stirring, isn&rsquo;t it! I take it that the Continental
Congress had moved over to Independence
Hall by this time,&rdquo; said Tom, when the reading was
done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they were over here, sitting in the East
Room, when they passed the Declaration of Independence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An attendant seeing the interested faces of the
young people, took them about the room and explained
the relics to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the very furniture that was in
the room at the time of the signing of the Declaration.
Right on this very table the Document received
the signature of the President of the Congress&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Hancock,&rdquo; murmured Helen to James in
an undertone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and the rest of them,&rdquo; continued the guide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the original document here?&rdquo; asked James,
who was thrilling with interest, but who preserved
the calmness which he inherited from his Scottish
ancestors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the caretaker. &ldquo;That is kept
at Washington in the Library of the State Department,
but there is an exact copy of it over there on
the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going upstairs, the party remembered to look up
the piece of the elm tree, under which Penn had
signed his Treaty with the Indians, and they saw in
addition the original Charter of Philadelphia, bearing
the date 1701.</p>
<p>In another room they found some furniture belonging
to Washington and Penn and various portraits
of more historic than artistic interest. They
enjoyed more seeing some of the boards of the original
floor. These were carefully kept under glass,
as if they were great treasures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re going to see the most sacred relic in
America, next to the Declaration itself,&rdquo; said Helen,
leading the way down the staircase at whose foot
was the famous Liberty Bell, which had rung out its
message of joy on July 4, 1775, when the delegates
passed the Declaration and the people of Philadelphia
knew that war was before them, and yet were
glad to meet whatever might be the outcome of the
defiance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>They gathered in silence around the bell and read
its description:&mdash;&ldquo;<span class="small">PROCLAIM LIBERTY TO ALL THE
LAND AND TO ALL THE INHABITANTS THEREOF.</span>&rdquo;
They noticed the crack which ran through it, and felt
that they were looking upon a real veteran of that
far-away time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather told me not to forget to tell you
about the little boy who gave the signal to the bell-ringer,&rdquo;
Helen said. &ldquo;He was stationed where he
could see the door-keeper of the room in which the
delegates were sitting. When the final vote was
taken, the door-keeper gave the signal to the boy and
he ran out, shouting the cry that resounded through
the colonies, &lsquo;Ring! Ring! Ring!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX
<br />HELEN DISTINGUISHES HERSELF</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come out into the Park for a few minutes,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Morton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m perfectly
sure Helen has some poetry to read to us before very
long, and if we can sit down for a minute or two on
the benches, we can hear it at our convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire of discontent had been smouldering for
a long time,&rdquo; said Helen, beginning her lecture
promptly when they were seated, &ldquo;and just as soon
as the Declaration was passed the flames burst
out. There was fighting all over the colonies
from South Carolina to New York City. Washington
was made Commander-in-Chief of the little
Army there, but he was quite unable to defeat the
large force which the British sent. He retreated
across New Jersey, and in December of 1776&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a year and a half later,&rdquo; interposed Ethel
Brown.</p>
<p>Helen nodded and continued: &ldquo;he reached the
Delaware River. The British followed him on the
other bank of the river, with the centre of the army
at Trenton, New Jersey. On Christmas Night of
1776, the future of the Colonies looked about as
dark as the night itself, but here is what happened,
told in some of the rhymes that Grandfather found
for us.&rdquo; And Helen read Virginia Woodward
Cloud&rsquo;s poem, called the &ldquo;Ballad of Sweet P.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;She was a spirited girl,&rdquo; said James gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was too nice a girl to be a deceiving girl,&rdquo;
said Ethel Blue, and a vigorous discussion as to how
much deception was fair in war time would have
broken out if Helen had not continued her account of
the Revolution around Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At day-break on the 26th of December, Washington
entered Trenton and surprised the enemy,&rdquo;
Helen ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in the battle of Trenton and in the battle
of Princeton about a week later, that our Emerson
great-great-great-grandfather fought, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
said Roger, recalling the account which his grandfather
had read to the Mortons several times from
the old family Bible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, don&rsquo;t you remember how he fought against
his daughter&rsquo;s English lover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must ask the chauffeur where the Betsy
Ross house is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton, rising and leading
the way to the car.</p>
<p>The man knew and set off at once through the few
narrow streets, and before long they were standing
in front of the old-fashioned dwelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the lady?&rdquo; murmured Tom in an undertone
to Ethel Brown, pretending to be afraid that
Helen would hear him but really speaking loudly
enough to draw her attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tom Watkins, you&rsquo;re perfectly dreadful,&rdquo; Helen
exclaimed promptly. &ldquo;Do you really mean that you
don&rsquo;t know who Betsy Ross was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This direct question was too much for Tom&rsquo;s
truthfulness and he broke into a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I should have known if I
hadn&rsquo;t read the other day a tale about a play that
some urchins wrote for the stage at Hull House in
Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Jane Addams tell the story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did, so it must be true. It was entirely original
with some immigrant boys who had been studying
American history. It went something like this:&mdash;in
the first act some American Revolutionary soldiers
are talking together and one of them says,
&lsquo;Gee, ain&rsquo;t it fierce! We ain&rsquo;t got no flag.&rsquo; The
others agreed that it was fierce. In the next act a
delegation of soldiers approached General Washington.
They saluted, and then said to him,
&lsquo;General, we ain&rsquo;t got no flag. Gee, ain&rsquo;t it
fierce?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s story was received with many giggles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Washington say?&rdquo; asked Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washington agreed that it was fierce, and said
that he&rsquo;d do something about it, so the next act shows
him at the house of Betsy Ross. He said to her,
&lsquo;Mrs. Ross, we ain&rsquo;t got no flag. Ain&rsquo;t it fierce?
What shall we do about it?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have a very large vocabulary,&rdquo;
laughed Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the American spirit was there,&rdquo; insisted
Mrs. Morton.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did Betsy say,&rdquo; inquired Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Ross said, &lsquo;It <i>is</i> fierce. You hold the
baby, George, and I&rsquo;ll make you something right
off.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that perfectly delicious!&rdquo; gurgled Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that last realistic scene took place in this little
house!&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton, shaking with mirth.
&ldquo;It belongs to the city now, so Betsy&rsquo;s patriotism
and industry are remembered by many visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Grandfather&rsquo;s contribution to this moment,&rdquo;
smiled Helen as she brought out still another
of her type-written sheets, and read some lines by
Minna Irving.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;BETSY&rsquo;S BATTLE FLAG</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;From dusk till dawn the livelong night</p>
<p class="t0">She kept the tallow dips alight,</p>
<p class="t0">And fast her nimble fingers flew</p>
<p class="t0">To sew the stars upon the blue.</p>
<p class="t0">With weary eyes and aching head</p>
<p class="t0">She stitched the stripes of white and red,</p>
<p class="t0">And when the day came up the stair</p>
<p class="t0">Complete across a carven chair</p>
<p class="t">Hung Betsy&rsquo;s battle flag.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Like the shadows in the evening gray</p>
<p class="t0">The Continentals filed away,</p>
<p class="t0">With broken boots and ragged coats,</p>
<p class="t0">But hoarse defiance in their throats;</p>
<p class="t0">They bore the marks of want and cold,</p>
<p class="t0">And some were lame and some were old,</p>
<p class="t0">And some with wounds untended bled,</p>
<p class="t0">But floating bravely overhead</p>
<p class="t">Was Betsy&rsquo;s battle flag.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;When fell the battle&rsquo;s leaden rain,</p>
<p class="t0">The soldier hushed his moan of pain</p>
<p class="t0">And raised his dying head to see</p>
<p class="t0">King George&rsquo;s troopers turn and flee.</p>
<p class="t0">Their charging column reeled and broke,</p>
<p class="t0">And vanished in the rolling smoke,</p>
<p class="t0">Before the glory of the stars,</p>
<p class="t0">The snowy stripes, and scarlet bars</p>
<p class="t">Of Betsy&rsquo;s battle flag.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The simple stone of Betsy Ross</p>
<p class="t0">Is covered now with mold and moss,</p>
<p class="t0">But still her deathless banner flies,</p>
<p class="t0">And keeps the color of the skies,</p>
<p class="t0">A nation thrills, a nation bleeds,</p>
<p class="t0">A nation follows where it leads,</p>
<p class="t0">And every man is proud to yield</p>
<p class="t0">His life upon a crimson field</p>
<p class="t">For Betsy&rsquo;s battle flag.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;When was it that Washington made his historic
visit to Betsy?&rdquo; asked Roger of Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was in June of 1776. A year later, on
the fourteenth of June, 1777, Congress adopted the
Stars and Stripes as our flag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why June 14th is celebrated as Flag Day,
I suppose,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think our flag has more meaning to it than any
other flag in the world,&rdquo; declared Roger. &ldquo;The
thirteen stripes mean the thirteen original colonies,
don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were thirteen stars at the beginning.
They&rsquo;ve added a star for every new state that has
joined the Union.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does make your heart beat to look
at it, especially when you happen to come on it suddenly
as Miss Bates said in those verses of hers that
we had in our Peace Day Program on Lincoln&rsquo;s
Birthday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Russian sea-captain once told me it looked to
him like a mosaic,&rdquo; Mrs. Morton said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But every piece of the mosaic is full of meaning,&rdquo;
said Ethel Blue, &ldquo;and mosaics make beautiful
pictures any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a sad time ahead for Philadelphia in
spite of Washington&rsquo;s successes at Trenton and
Princeton,&rdquo; said Helen, taking up her story once
more. &ldquo;The Americans were successful in Vermont
and northern New York, but in September, 1777,
they were defeated at Brandywine Creek, and the
British marched into Philadelphia a fortnight later
and took possession of the town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it about that time that the American
army spent the winter at Valley Forge?&rdquo; asked Margaret.
&ldquo;I seem to remember something about their
living in a great deal of distress, such as the soldiers
in Europe are enduring now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the time,&rdquo; confirmed Helen.
&ldquo;Grandfather has a few lines of Reed&rsquo;s here telling
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Such was the winter&rsquo;s awful sight,</p>
<p class="t0">For many a dreary day and night,</p>
<p class="t0">What time our country&rsquo;s hope forlorn,</p>
<p class="t0">Of every needed comfort shorn,</p>
<p class="t0">Lay housed within a buried tent,</p>
<p class="t0">Where every keen blast found a rent,</p>
<p class="t0">And oft the snow was seen to sift</p>
<p class="t0">Along the floor its piling drift,</p>
<p class="t0">Or, mocking the scant blanket&rsquo;s fold,</p>
<p class="t0">Across the night-couch frequent rolled;</p>
<p class="t0">Where every path by a soldier beat,</p>
<p class="t0">Or every track where a sentinel stood,</p>
<p class="t0">Still held the print of naked feet,</p>
<p class="t0">And oft the crimson stains of blood;</p>
<p class="t0">Where Famine held her spectral court,</p>
<p class="t0">And joined by all her fierce allies;</p>
<p class="t0">She ever loved a camp or fort</p>
<p class="t0">Beleaguered by the wintry skies,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">But chiefly when Disease is by,</p>
<p class="t0">To sink frame and dim the eye,</p>
<p class="t0">Until, with seeking forehead bent,</p>
<p class="t0">In martial garments cold and damp,</p>
<p class="t0">Pale Death patrols from tent to tent,</p>
<p class="t0">To count the charnels of the camp.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Such was the winter that prevailed</p>
<p class="t0">Within the crowded, frozen gorge;</p>
<p class="t0">Such were the horrors that assailed</p>
<p class="t0">The patriot band at Valley Forge.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;How long did the British hold the city?&rdquo; asked
Tom, after he had shaken his head over the Americans&rsquo;
troubles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Six or eight months,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;and you can
imagine what a thrilling time it was for American
girls like Sweet P. I can fancy them walking
daintily along the street turning their heads aside
when a British officer passed them, as if he were too
far beneath their notice for them even to glance
at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed at the picture that Helen&rsquo;s words
drew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Sir Henry Clinton evacuated Philadelphia
in the middle of June, he started for New York.
Washington followed him but did not win in the
skirmish which they fought at Monmouth, New Jersey.
The Indians on the western frontier had joined
the British, and there was some terrible fighting
there. Our fleet, as a general thing, was successful
on the ocean. Clinton stayed for more than a year
in New York City. Washington established himself
just above the city where he could keep an eye on
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that the time when my old friend, Anthony
Wayne, stirred up a little excitement up the
Hudson?&rdquo; asked Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was then he took Stony Point, which we
saw when we went up the river to West Point.
There was fighting in New Jersey and in the South,
and the British seemed to be getting tired out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was at the end of several sharply fought fields
that Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown in Virginia,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; inquired Roger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Tom looked at him with exaggerated respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is a great thing to be related to the
Army and Navy. Here&rsquo;s Helen, a walking &lsquo;History
of the Revolution,&rsquo; and old Roger actually remembering
something about Cornwallis&rsquo;s surrender!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; acknowledged Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell a story about the way that Philadelphia
heard the news of the surrender,&rdquo; interposed
the caretaker of the Betsy Ross house, who had
been listening to the conversation. &ldquo;There was an
old German watchman walking the streets, and calling
the hours through the night, as was the custom
then. He cried out; &lsquo;Bast dree o&rsquo;clock and Cornvallis
ist daken.&rsquo; People who had turned over in
bed growling when they had been awakened by him
before, were only too thankful to hear his hoarse
voice croaking out the good news.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was in October, 1781,&rdquo; went on Helen,
after nodding her thanks to the caretaker for his addition
to the story. &ldquo;It took a good many months
for the British to leave the country, for transportation
was a difficult matter at that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you the Americans were thankful to have
peace,&rdquo; exclaimed James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds to me very much as if the British were,
too,&rdquo; said Roger. &ldquo;Any country must be grateful
for a rest from such long distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandfather&rsquo;s poetry is by Freneau this time,&rdquo;
said Helen. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to read you only two
stanzas of it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;The great unequal conflict past,</p>
<p class="t0">The Britons banished from our shore,</p>
<p class="t0">Peace, heaven-descended, comes at last,</p>
<p class="t0">And hostile nations rage no more;</p>
<p class="t0">From fields of death the weary swain</p>
<p class="t0">Returning, seeks his native plain.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In every vale she smiles serene,</p>
<p class="t0">Freedom&rsquo;s bright stars more radiant rise,</p>
<p class="t0">New charms she adds to every scene,</p>
<p class="t0">Her brighter sun illumes our skies.</p>
<p class="t0">Remotest realms admiring stand,</p>
<p class="t0">And hail the HERO of our Land.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the Hero?&rdquo; inquired Tom. &ldquo;Washington,
I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;These verses were
written when he was traveling through Philadelphia
on his way to Mt. Vernon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know enough American history to tell you that
he didn&rsquo;t stay there long,&rdquo; said Tom, proud of
being able to bring forward one sure piece of information.
&ldquo;He was made President on his war
record. That I do know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all applauded this contribution. The care-taker
of the house again could not resist joining the
conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The five years after the signing of the Treaty
of Peace in 1783 were very critical years,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;The new country had almost no money and no definite
policy, now that they had cut themselves free
from England. Somebody proposed a Federal Convention
and it met here in Philadelphia in 1787.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did they want to do this time?&rdquo; asked
Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now they had to draw up some sort of Constitution
for the new country. Washington was chosen
President of the Convention and they worked from
May until September in planning the Constitution,
which they nick-named the &lsquo;New Roof.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know about that,&rdquo; cried Helen.
&ldquo;Grandfather gave me a poem about that. He
thought we&rsquo;d be especially interested in it on account
of Dorothy knowing so much about the building of a
house,&rdquo;&mdash;and she read them the old poem called
&lsquo;The New Roof,&rsquo; by Francis Hopkinson, one of the
signers of the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now that we have put the United States on a
good running foundation, I think we might finish up
our Revolutionary history by whirling out to Valley
Forge,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a delightful ride,
and I think we could do it comfortably in what is left
of the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad,&rdquo; said Helen, pretending extreme
fatigue, &ldquo;for these ignorant people have made me
work so hard remembering dates and things, that I&rsquo;m
quite exhausted, and I&rsquo;d like to sit still and view the
scenery for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chauffeur said that he could manage the ride
and even give them time for a walk when they
reached their destination, if they were not in a hurry
to return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it would be fun to come back in the evening,&rdquo;
said Margaret, and they started off with great
satisfaction.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>As they passed Fairmount Park they promised
themselves to see it in detail in the morning, but now
there was only time to notice that much of it had
been left in a natural condition, which was far more
beautiful than any results that Art could have
brought about.</p>
<p>The road lay through a rolling country with pleasant
suburban towns and comfortable-looking farm
houses. At Valley Forge they felt like real pilgrims
at a shrine, for they remembered the bitter suffering
of the American soldiers and the even greater mental
anguish of their leader, who sometimes felt that he
had led his brave men into this distress, and might
not be able to lead them to the victory which he must
have, if the colonies were to become independent of
the land they had sprung from.</p>
<p>Across the surrounding hills they walked, reading
with utmost interest the monuments and markers
which commemorate events and places and people
connected with this fateful winter. Below swept
the Schuylkill River, between peaceful banks, far
different from those that hem it in farther down, as
it runs through the great city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X
<br />THE LAND OF &ldquo;CAT-FISH AND WAFFLES&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It was a tired party that tumbled into bed that
night but the long ride in the fresh air made them
sleep like tops and they awoke the next morning entirely
refreshed, and ready to start out again on their
investigations of the City of Brotherly Love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day I am not going to open my mouth,&rdquo; said
Helen. &ldquo;I talked altogether too much yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were a wonder,&rdquo; said Tom, admiringly.
&ldquo;I wish I could remember dates the way you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said Helen, with a finger on her lip.
&ldquo;My energetic grandfather blocked out the whole
history of Philadelphia in the revolutionary days for
me, so it was not my unaided memory that reeled off
all that information. Any way, I&rsquo;m going to sit
back and have the rest of you inform me to-day about
the places we shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to see?&rdquo; inquired Roger.
&ldquo;Mother, you know this village; can&rsquo;t you make out
a list for us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton said that she had some suggestions
to make and Roger jotted them down in a book.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are one or two churches,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;which have an interest because they are old, or have
connection with some important person or because
there is some strangeness about the way they are
built.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall like those,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to try to draw some of the doorways for Miss
Graham. She asked me to draw any little thing
about buildings that I thought would interest her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see some old-timey doorways in Rittenhouse
Square,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton. &ldquo;That is like
Washington Square in New York, only here the
whole square has been preserved in its former
beauty. You&rsquo;ll find more than one doorway, and
which will be worth putting into your sketch book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it take too much time to see the Mint?&rdquo;
asked James. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t want to suggest it if it
will take too long, but it would be awfully interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the Mint on my list,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton,
tapping her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll transfer it from that spot to paper,&rdquo; laughed
Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we can get the same chauffeur we had
yesterday,&rdquo; said Ethel Brown; &ldquo;he knew a lot about
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s accustomed to driving tourists,&rdquo;
replied her mother.</p>
<p>As good fortune would have it they were able to
secure the same car, and the good-natured driver
beamed at them, as they stowed themselves away as
they had the day before. Mrs. Morton told him the
chief &ldquo;sights&rdquo; which they wanted to see, and directed
him to point out anything that they passed
which would have some interest for the young people.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>First they went over to the old part of the town
along the Delaware, to find one of the churches of
which Mrs. Morton had spoken. On the way they
stopped at Christ Church. Its high box pews
seemed to them full of dignity, and they imagined
the elaborately arranged head-dresses of the ladies
and powdered wigs of the gentlemen, rising above
the old-fashioned seats. The pulpit was high up on
one side of the chancel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the church that was presided over by
Bishop White, the first Episcopal bishop of Pennsylvania,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Morton. &ldquo;He was influential in
organizing the Episcopal Church in this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out in the graveyard, whose quiet seemed
strangely out of place amid the hurry of the city,
they found many stones bearing well-known names,
among them that of Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He died in 1790,&rdquo; read Delia, from the stone.
&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that just about the time Washington was
elected President?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One year after,&rdquo; said Helen, who could not resist
giving historical information. &ldquo;The first real
American Congress after the separation of the country
from England met here in Philadelphia in 1789,
and elected Washington as President.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t escape a little history as long as Sister
Helen is around,&rdquo; murmured Roger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t I who started it,&rdquo; retorted Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, children, be quiet. You may thank your
stars that your sister knows so much about history,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Morton; &ldquo;it would be an excellent thing,
Roger, if you stowed away some of it in your brain,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; answered Roger meekly.</p>
<p>It was while the car was on its way to the second
old church of their search that the chauffeur asked
James, who was sitting beside him, if he knew that
&ldquo;Hail Columbia&rdquo; was written in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;Helen, did
you know that &lsquo;Hail Columbia&rsquo; was written in Philadelphia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;Tell
me about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his eyes on the road and his hands on the
wheel the chauffeur told James, who repeated the
story over his shoulder to those in the back of the
car, that while John Adams was president, there was
a war scare, because French vessels were supposed to
be off the coast ready to attack American merchant
vessels. A man named John Hopkinson wrote the
poem, which was sung one night at the Chestnut
Street Theatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean our &lsquo;Hail Columbia&rsquo;&mdash;the regular
&lsquo;Hail Columbia&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>The chauffeur nodded at Ethel Brown. Her
memory for verses was always good and she repeated
the first stanza of the stirring song.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Hail Columbia, happy land!</p>
<p class="t0">Hail! Ye Heroes, heaven-born band,</p>
<p class="t0">Who fought and bled in freedom&rsquo;s cause,</p>
<p class="t0">Who fought and bled in freedom&rsquo;s cause,</p>
<p class="t0">And when the storm of war was gone,</p>
<p class="t0">Enjoyed the peace your valor won;</p>
<p class="t0">Let independence be your boast,</p>
<p class="t0">Ever mindful what it cost,</p>
<p class="t0">Ever grateful for the prize,</p>
<p class="t0">Let its altar reach the skies.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>They all joined in the chorus.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Firm united let us be,</p>
<p class="t0">Rallying round our liberty,</p>
<p class="t0">As a band of brothers joined,</p>
<p class="t0">Peace and safety we shall find.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Almost on the river, toward the southern end of
the town, was the church which the chauffeur called
&ldquo;Old Swedes Church,&rdquo; and whose correct name,
Mrs. Morton said, was &ldquo;Gloria Dei.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old is it?&rdquo; asked Dicky who was beginning
to understand that they were on a historical pilgrimage.
They all laughed at his seriousness, and his
mother answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This building is only a little over two centuries
old&mdash;but it&rsquo;s on the site of an old wooden church
that was built in 1646. It was a Swedish church,
originally, and then the whole congregation turned
Episcopal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look as if they lived around the church
in any great numbers,&rdquo; said Tom, gazing about him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Most of the parishioners live now a long way
from here,&rdquo; said the chauffeur, &ldquo;but they love the
church because they are the descendants of the original
founders, and they come from great distances
to the morning services and stay to Sunday School,
old people and young ones, too, and cook their dinner
in the Parish House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds like a New England village church
to which all the farmers from around about come for
the day,&rdquo; said Margaret Hancock. &ldquo;I used to see
them when I was a little girl and we went to New
Hampshire for the summer. They bring their lunch
and eat it under the trees between services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we seem to be doing churches, we ought
to go to a Quaker Meeting House,&rdquo; suggested Mrs.
Morton, turning to the chauffeur for information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one up on 12th Street, madam,&rdquo; he responded.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a boys&rsquo; school connected with
it that is very well known&mdash;the Penn Charter
School. Lots of the old Quaker families send their
boys there still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose there would be a meeting to-day,&rdquo;
inquired Helen.</p>
<p>The chauffeur shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t like it, any way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
a Quaker myself, and I know when I was your age it
was awfully hard work to keep still so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it worse than any other kind of church?&rdquo;
asked Dicky.</p>
<p>The driver nodded again, dexterously avoiding a
big truck as he answered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The congregation just sits there until the Spirit
moves someone to speak. I&rsquo;ve been there many a
time when they sat for two hours and nothing happened
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel Blue, shaking her
head gravely; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I could keep still as
long as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it&rsquo;s just as well that there is no meeting
to-day,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton. &ldquo;Any way, I don&rsquo;t
know that I should approve of your going to a religious
service out of curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom nodded in agreement with Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Father wouldn&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Tom&rsquo;s father was a clergyman in New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t object to our going to other
churches,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;but he has seen so much of
tourists who come to New York and go around the
city, taking in three or four churches on Sunday
morning merely to hear the music or some celebrated
speaker, that he has always warned us children
against being &lsquo;religious rubber-necks.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed and contented themselves with
looking at the outside of the severely plain meeting-house.</p>
<p>The tour over the Mint was filled with interest for
all of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the oldest Mint in the United States,&rdquo;
the guide explained to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the date?&rdquo; Helen could not resist asking,
although Roger shook his head at her and Tom
visibly smothered a smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;1792&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;We turn out gold
and silver and copper here and we&rsquo;ve done a great
deal of minting for South America, and, of late
years, for the Philippines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys were most interested in the processes by
which the discs were cut out of plain sheets of metal
and were then fed into tubes of just the right size to
hold them, until they reached the stamping machine
which gave them the impress they were to wear
through life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those new gold pieces are certainly beauties,&rdquo;
said Roger, looking at the eagle flying through the
air on one coin and then at the same majestic bird
standing with dignity on another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think this Indian has a very handsome
nose,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue, critically, as she examined a
five-cent piece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think how appropriate it is,&mdash;the noble red-man
on one side of the nickel, and the buffalo of the
plains on the other,&rdquo; returned James.</p>
<p>The girls were more interested in the coin collection
in the Mint&rsquo;s museum. Here they saw not only
American coins, from the earliest to the most recent,
but coins of other countries. One of them was the
tiny bit of metal known as the &ldquo;Widow&rsquo;s Mite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Widow didn&rsquo;t have to be very muscular to
carry that around,&rdquo; commented Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she must have had a separate bag to put it
in or it would have been lost,&rdquo; returned practical
Ethel Brown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing doing in the Academy of Fine
Arts now, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; the chauffeur told Mrs. Morton,
when she got into the car again. &ldquo;It has a
grand exhibition every winter but it&rsquo;s closed for the
summer. Would you like to see the collections?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was put to the party and they agreed
that they would prefer to stay out of doors in this
brilliant summer weather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make an expedition to the Metropolitan
Museum some day before long,&rdquo; promised Mrs.
Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we might do it soon,&rdquo; said Dorothy.
&ldquo;Miss Graham said she&rsquo;d go with us, and I think
we should learn a lot from her because she&rsquo;s half
an artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ask her to take us as soon as we get back,&rdquo;
said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m crazy about her, and this
would be a good chance for us to be with her for
almost all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that you have your opportunity soon,&rdquo;
her Aunt Marion promised her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have time to run out to Mt. Airy this morning,&rdquo;
suggested the chauffeur. &ldquo;Then after luncheon,
you could go to the Park and the Zoo in the
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Mt. Airy?&rdquo; asked Della.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the finest deaf and dumb asylums in
America,&rdquo; replied the young man proudly.</p>
<p>Della shook her head and the rest of them pulled
such long faces Mrs. Morton could not resist smiling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I rather think these young people care more
for human beings who can talk and hear,&rdquo; she said
to the chauffeur. &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; she went on,
looking at her watch, &ldquo;I must meet my business appointment
now, so I suggest, Roger, that you take
our party to Wanamaker&rsquo;s. You can see a lot of
interesting things there, and can have your luncheon,
and I&rsquo;ll meet you there when I am through with
my business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was arranged, and the chauffeur was ordered
for three o&rsquo;clock to take them to Fairmount Park.</p>
<p>At the appointed hour his cheerful face greeted
them once again. Because of the Mortons&rsquo; interest
in the Navy, they first ran south to the League
Island Navy Yard. Even their familiarity with
many Navy Yards did not lessen their interest in
this one, with its rows of officers&rsquo; houses and its barracks
and mess-room. Just because they were so
familiar with similar places, however, they did not
stay long, and the car was soon whirling northwards
to the opposite end of the city. They went through
miles and miles of streets lined with small houses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the houses which have given Philadelphia
the nick-name of the &lsquo;City of Homes,&rsquo;&rdquo; exclaimed
Mrs. Morton. &ldquo;You see, in New York
people are crowded on to a small tongue of land,
between two rivers. Here there are two rivers
also, but the space between them is wider. There&rsquo;s
nothing to prevent the city&rsquo;s crossing the Schuylkill
and running westward, as it began to do many long
years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These houses aren&rsquo;t very beautiful,&rdquo; commented
Ethel Blue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They are very neat,&rdquo; said Ethel Brown. &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t you get tired of these red bricks and white shutters,
and the little flights of white marble steps, all
alike? I don&rsquo;t see how anybody knows when he
has come home. I should think people would all
the time be getting into their neighbors&rsquo; houses by
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is much more wholesome for a family to
have a house to itself, than for many families to be
crowded into one building,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why,&rdquo; objected Tom, who had been
born and reared in New York. &ldquo;The large buildings
are wonderfully constructed now-a-days for ventilation
and sanitation. They couldn&rsquo;t be better in
that respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton, &ldquo;but a family
loses something of its privacy when it lives in
a building with other people. The householder is
responsible for his own heating, his own side-walk,
and so on, for all matters whose good care makes
for the happiness of his family. The apartment
dweller loses that work for the well-being of his
family, when he lets go its responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are right, Mrs. Morton,&rdquo; said
Tom, &ldquo;but in these days of co-operation, it seems
to me you gain something by uniting, as apartment
house people practically do, to hire some one to take
the responsibility of the heating arrangements, the
side-walks, the ashes, and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It all depends on the conditions,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
Morton. &ldquo;In New York, especially on Manhattan
Island, where land is so valuable that buildings must
go up in the air, such co-operation has become desirable,
but where there is plenty of space, it seems
better for every household to be separate as far as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chauffeur called their attention, as they
passed through Logan Square, to the fact that this
was the fourth city square they had seen since they
had been in his care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On our way south from the Penn Treaty Park,
we went through Franklin Square, and then you saw
Washington Square when you were down by Independence
Hall. This morning you saw Rittenhouse
Square. Logan is the fourth. These four squares
were laid out by William Penn as a part of the original
design of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not far from Logan Square they were enabled to
reach the bank of the Schuylkill, and the rest of
the afternoon they spent in the lovely Park through
which flows this river and the picturesque little
Wissahickon.</p>
<p>Their first visit was to the Zoo, which the
chauffeur told them was one of the finest in the
United States. They invested in peanuts and small
cakes and made themselves popular with the animals
whose cages they passed.</p>
<p>Then they drove on, gliding swiftly in and out
among the stately trees which the engineers of the
Park had had the good sense to leave as they found
them. Along the Wissahickon they noticed many
small inns, all of which showed signs, inviting passers-by
to come in and partake of &ldquo;Cat-fish and
Waffles.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can understand the waffle supply being limited
only by the energy of the cooks,&rdquo; exclaimed Roger,
as he read one of the numerous summonses, &ldquo;but if
they catch the cat-fish in the Wissahickon they must
keep an army of fishermen out in the boats all day
long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we could go out on the river,&rdquo; murmured
Helen, as they whirled along the banks of the
Schuylkill. &ldquo;It looks so refreshing there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we can get a barge at one of these boat
houses and go up the river a little way,&rdquo; suggested
Mrs. Morton, turning inquiringly to the chauffeur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty bit from about here up to a place
called &lsquo;The Lilacs,&rsquo;&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pretty
little club house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do lets do it,&rdquo; cried Ethel Blue excitedly.
&ldquo;It would be lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went to a near-by boat house and made
the arrangements. The boats were large, with seats
for four rowers besides the seats in the stern and
bow.</p>
<p>The Ethels had learned to row at Chautauqua the
summer before, so they occupied one seat.</p>
<p>The three boys each took one of the other seats,
each rowing a single oar. Helen sat on the seat
with Tom, Margaret with Roger, and Dorothy with
James.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton and Dicky sat in the stern, and Della
played look-out in the bow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>It was a charming pull between shores beautiful
by nature and gay with boat houses from which
merry parties were establishing themselves in boats
and barges and canoes. The rowers found the trip
not too hard upon the muscles, even the Ethels saying
that they were not at all tired, when The Lilacs
came in sight.</p>
<p>The car met them at the Club House because they
had to go back to the hotel and pack their bags in
order to catch the train for home. The chauffeur
had brought up with him a man from the boat house,
to take the barge back where it belonged.</p>
<p>They returned over different streets to the city
so that they felt that they had a good idea of the
geography of the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a perfectly stunning time, Mrs. Morton,&rdquo;
said Tom, as he bade her &ldquo;Good-bye&rdquo; on the
train and thanked her for her care. &ldquo;It has been
splendid fun, and my only grief is that I am afraid
Helen may have fatigued her brain, remembering all
that history!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen wrinkled her nose at him, but she laughed
good-naturedly and agreed with him that the trip
had been great fun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI
<br />LIGHTS AND A FALL</h2>
<p>It was not often that Ethel Blue took a violent
fancy to any one. Although she had something
of the temperament that artists claim to have,
she also had great reserve, and she found the companionship
of her cousins, Ethel Brown and Dorothy,
quite sufficient for her.</p>
<p>Now, however, she was filled with admiration for
Margaret&rsquo;s aunt, Miss Graham. Miss Graham
suited her in so many ways. She was good to look
at, and Ethel found herself gazing at her wholesome,
amiable face, filled with life and earnestness
and fun, and enjoyed it quite as much as if she had
great beauty.</p>
<p>Then, Miss Graham, because of her occupation
as an interior decorator, knew something about art,
and Ethel Blue wanted to know how to draw and
paint, and how to appreciate pictures. She found
that she never met Miss Graham without realizing
afterwards that she had learned something from
her. Perhaps it was only the meaning of a new
phrase, or perhaps Miss Daisy called her attention
to the light on the group of figures in some picture,
or to the harmonies of color in the landscape.
Whatever it was, it was not brought out in any
preachy way and yet Ethel Blue found herself with
quite a store of information that had come from her
new friend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Miss Graham did not seem to single out Ethel
Blue for particular attention. They naturally
drifted together when there was a large party, because
their tastes were similar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think your aunt Daisy is nicer than any aunt
in the world except my aunt Marion,&rdquo; Ethel Blue
confided to Margaret one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just about what James and I think,&rdquo; said
Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she finished her Englewood house?&rdquo; inquired
Ethel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that was done some time ago. That&rsquo;s
why she has been able to go to see Mrs. Smith so
many times recently. She has spent several afternoons
at Sweetbrier Lodge, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remembering this, Ethel Blue went to the new
house one afternoon especially to see if Miss Graham
was there. She had no definite reason for doing
so&mdash;she merely thought she would like to see
her. By good luck Miss Graham was there, as she
had brought out some samples of hangings to show
to Mrs. Smith, and she was waiting on the terrace
for her to come, and resting as she waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see you, child,&rdquo; she called to Ethel
Blue, and Ethel did not resent being called a child,
for she realized that it was merely an endearing
word coming from Miss Daisy&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bring one of those canvas chairs over here beside
me,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll look at the view and
talk a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it going to be lovely when the real furniture
is on the terrace here?&rdquo; said Ethel Blue
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The view is lovely, no matter what the chairs
are,&rdquo; returned Miss Graham, smiling at her affectionately.
&ldquo;When do you think your aunt is coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Did she expect you? Shall I
run back to the house and tell her you are here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, probably I&rsquo;m a little early and I shall enjoy
sitting here and talking with you until she
comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel felt much complimented by this desire on
Miss Graham&rsquo;s part and placed her chair beside
her.</p>
<p>Their eyes looked out across the field with its
brook and the trees that sheltered Mr. Emerson&rsquo;s
house. Across the street the meadows, rich with
the field flowers of late summer, stretched away towards
the distant river, and beyond that were more
trees rearing their heights across the sky.</p>
<p>As they looked a shadow fell on the meadow and
moved swiftly across it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks as if some huge birds were flying between
the earth and the sun,&rdquo; smiled Miss Daisy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it go fast!&rdquo; returned Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notice the change in the color of the meadow,
when the sunlight is hidden for a minute and then
falls again on the vegetation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Ethel Blue nodded, for she saw that the change
was almost as if a sheet of colored glass had been
held over a strong electric light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes during a thunder shower,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen awfully queer colors over in that
meadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The air is charged with electric particles sometimes,&rdquo;
explained Miss Daisy, &ldquo;and you are looking
through them. You get different color effects during
an ordinary rain storm, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think rain over that meadow is going to be
one of the prettiest things Dorothy will see from this
terrace,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will have a long sweep to watch and a
shower moves sometimes fast and sometimes slowly,
so there will be opportunity to notice many changes,&rdquo;
suggested Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if Aunt Louise is going to have electric
lights out here on the porch,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.
&ldquo;They will draw the mosquitoes like everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she won&rsquo;t mind that because she can stay
inside of her wire cage,&rdquo; answered Miss Daisy.
&ldquo;Surely she&rsquo;s going to have electric lights. Don&rsquo;t
you see the wires already put in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; answered Ethel Blue. &ldquo;How
stupid of me! Those black ends are poking out all
over the house and somehow I never thought what
they were for.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you haven&rsquo;t noticed the lighting scheme
that your Aunt and Dorothy have worked out.
Let&rsquo;s walk through the house now, and see just how
she has arranged it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went through the door of the screen into
the enclosed portion and then into the dining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people have one of those hang-down
lights over the dining table,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see any wire for one here. I&rsquo;m glad Aunt
Louise isn&rsquo;t going to have one. They never are the
right height. You always have to be dodging under
them to see the person across from you and the light
shines on the table so brilliantly that you&rsquo;re almost
afraid to eat anything it falls on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Graham laughed at Ethel&rsquo;s vigorous protest,
but she said that she, too, did not like a central
light over the dining table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no need of a very brilliant light in a
dining room,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You can see the people
about the table without any difficulty in a subdued
light and the general effect is far more beautiful than
when people are sitting in a glare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think candle light is prettiest for the dining
room,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is prettiest for the table,&rdquo; replied Miss Graham.
&ldquo;The place where you really want a strong
light is over the serving table behind the screen.
You don&rsquo;t want the maid to make any mistakes just
because she can&rsquo;t see clearly the dishes she is handling.
There you need a strong light, but it can be
placed so low that the screen shields it for the room
and it will not interfere with the dimmer light of the
rest of the room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose there ought to be other lights in the
room,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;You might find that
there weren&rsquo;t any candles in the house some evening
and then it would be awful to have only this light
over the serving table and none of them in other
parts of the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Graham laughed at the possibility of such a
disaster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be side-lights over the mantel-place,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;electric lights that look like candles, with
pretty candle shades, and one or two similar arrangements
on the other side of the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever put a central light in the dining
rooms you decorate?&rdquo; asked Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I let the light flow out from a dull,
golden globe set into the ceiling over the table. The
glass of the bowl is so thick that only a gentle radiance
comes from it and yet it ekes out the light from
the candles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethel Brown is particularly pleased with the
switch out in the vestibule,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;You
see you can come home when the house is all dark,
and light the electricity in the hall by turning on the
switch outside of the front door. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be
a good joke on a burglar, if he did it by accident
some night when he was trying to get in,&rdquo; laughed
the young girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a capital invention,&rdquo; said Miss Graham.
&ldquo;You notice your aunt has side lights here in the
hall. Have you ever happened to be in a house
where they were moving the furniture about and
every piece that passed the hall chandelier gave it
a rap?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it is in the house we&rsquo;re in now,&rdquo;
said Ethel. &ldquo;Every time any one goes away and
the express man brings down a trunk, he hits the
light in the hall. I don&rsquo;t know how many globes
Aunt Marion has had broken that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upstairs they found the same side-lighting in all
the bed rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The theory of it is,&rdquo; said Miss Graham, &ldquo;that
when you want to see anything very clearly, you put
in a light close to the place where you need to work.
If you are going to arrange your hair before your
dressing table, you want a light directly over your
dressing glass. If you are going to read you turn
on a light beside your reading stand. An upper
light is usually for general illumination and a side
light for real service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A combination of the two lights makes a room
ready for anything,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to notice particularly the fixtures that
your Aunt Louise has selected for indirect lighting,&rdquo;
said Miss Graham. &ldquo;She has chosen beautiful
bowls that look like alabaster. They turn upwards
and the bulbs are hidden in them. The
strong glare is against the ceiling so that the people
get only the reflected light. There is to be one
of those bowls on a high standard in the front hall,
and one at the turn of the stair-case. They look
like ancient Roman urns, giving forth a marvelous
radiance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think that will be prettier than some clear,
engraved glass covers, that I saw the other day,&rdquo;
said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;They showed the bulbs right
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far prettier,&rdquo; agreed Miss Graham. &ldquo;The
whole object of this indirect light is to make your
room seem to be lighted by a glow whose real origin
you hardly know. Of course your intelligence tells
you that there are electric bulbs up there, but you
don&rsquo;t want really to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that people must be thinking
more about how to make things pretty than they
used to,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;When Ethel Brown&rsquo;s
grandfather built his house, Aunt Marion says it
was thought very handsome by everybody in Rosemont.
It has lots of convenient things in it, and
plenty of brilliant lights, but the fixtures aren&rsquo;t
pretty and the idea seems to be to make just as big
a shine as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowadays,&rdquo; said Miss Graham, &ldquo;people try
to make the useful things beautiful also whenever
they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to learn all about a house,&rdquo; said Ethel
Blue, &ldquo;because some time I may have to keep house
for my father and I want to know everything there
is to know. Of course army people have to live in
Uncle Sam&rsquo;s houses, but still there are always different
arrangements you can introduce, even in a
government house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll be able to make useful everything
you learn,&rdquo; said Miss Graham, &ldquo;and your
father will be pleased with whatever makes the
house lovelier and more comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always meant to ask whether you didn&rsquo;t
know my father,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;He is at Fort
Myer, near Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Richard Morton,&rdquo; said Miss Daisy.
&ldquo;Yes, indeed. I know a great many of the officers
and their families at Fort Myer. I&rsquo;ve met your father
and I know him well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the dearest old darling that ever
walked?&rdquo; said Ethel Blue, bouncing with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly is a very nice person,&rdquo; agreed Miss
Graham, smiling, &ldquo;and he thinks he has one of the
finest daughters who ever walked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he really?&rdquo; cried Ethel Blue. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
glad he does! You see, I so seldom see him that
sometimes I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll forget all about me.
Once when he came to Rosemont, I passed him in the
street when he was walking up from the station, and
he didn&rsquo;t know me and I didn&rsquo;t know him. Wasn&rsquo;t
that perfectly frightful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was too bad,&rdquo; agreed Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somehow I&rsquo;ve never thought of being able to
live with him,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve
always lived with Aunt Marion, because my mother
died when I was a little bit of a baby, but the other
day somebody said something about my going to
Father later on, and I haven&rsquo;t been able to think of
anything else since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he wants you,&rdquo; said Miss Graham.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Has he spoken to you about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to be a million times older
than I am now, before he thinks I&rsquo;m able to take care
of him,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it will be a whole million years,&rdquo;
smiled Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall feel dreadfully to leave Aunt Marion
and Ethel Brown. I&rsquo;ve never been away from
Ethel Brown more than three or four days in my
whole life,&rdquo; said Ethel Brown&rsquo;s twin cousin, &ldquo;but if
my father needs me, why of course, I must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you must,&rdquo; returned Miss Graham,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure he wants you just as soon as he can
send for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel Blue was so overjoyed at this opinion, that
she jumped up on the ledge on the top of the parapet
running around the terrace, and danced with delight
the fancy step&mdash;&ldquo;One, two, three, back; one,
two, three, back&rdquo;&mdash;with which she and Ethel
Brown were accustomed to express great satisfaction
with the way in which life was treating them.</p>
<p>To Miss Graham&rsquo;s horror, Ethel Blue&rsquo;s enthusiasm
blinded her eyes and her third back step took
her off the parapet. She fell to the ground and
rolled down the hill, her slender little body bouncing
from rock to rock with cruel force and increasing
speed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Miss Graham gave a cry of distress and vaulted
over the parapet with the ease which she had acquired
in the gymnasium in her college days. Running
the risk of rolling down hill herself, she
bounded down the steep slope, and reached the foot
almost as soon as did the body of the young girl,
which lay very still, its head against the stone which
had brought unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Miss Graham turned over the limp little form,
shuddering as she saw the bruise on the forehead.
She tried to lift it but found she could make no
progress up the steep knoll. Again and again she
called to the workmen in the house, and finally two
of them appeared at an upper window and made
gestures of understanding when she beckoned to
them. They leaped down the hill with long strides,
and soon were carrying Ethel Blue up to the terrace.</p>
<p>They laid her gently on the floor and ran to get
water from the hydrant, while Miss Graham slipped
off the young girl&rsquo;s shoes, raised her feet upon a
block of wood that happened to be near by, so
that the blood might flow towards her heart, and
gently chafed her wrists. When the water came,
she dashed a shower of it from the tips of her fingers
on the pale little face lying so quietly against
the bricks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I run to de nex&rsquo; house an&rsquo; telephone for de
doctor?&rdquo; asked one of the men, and Miss Graham
nodded an assent and added a direction to summon
Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>Before either her aunt or the doctor came, however,
Ethel Blue returned to consciousness. Before
she opened her eyes, she heard a soft, affectionate
voice crooning over her, &ldquo;My dear little girl,
my poor little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>She kept her eyes closed for a minute or two, so
pleasant was this sound from the lips of Miss Graham
whom she had grown to love so fondly. When
at last she opened her eyes and saw Miss Daisy&rsquo;s
anxious face change its expression to one of delight,
she almost felt that it was worth while to fall off a
precipice to bring about such a result.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII
<br />IN THE FAMILY HOSPITAL</h2>
<p>Mrs. Morton was acting as head nurse in
the home hospital. Ethel Blue&rsquo;s injuries
from her fall were not serious, but besides the
bruises on her forehead, she had numerous large
black and blue spots all over her body and she had
been so shaken that the doctor thought it was well
for her to stay in bed for a day or two.</p>
<p>In addition to Ethel Blue, Dicky was laid low
for the time being. He had gone over to his grandfather&rsquo;s
and as he was accustomed to run about
the farm by himself, and as he usually stayed near
some of the workmen, nobody paid any attention to
him. This time, however, he went up into the pasture,
where he found most of the cows lying down
in the shade of the trees and meditatively chewing
their cuds after their morning meal.</p>
<p>Dicky was not in the least afraid of cows, having
been familiar with them from his babyhood.
He therefore walked up to one of the prostrate creatures
and sat down comfortably upon her neck,
steadying himself by her nearest horn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Nothing happened for a minute of two, for either
his weight was so slight that the cow hardly noticed
it, or else his position did not interfere with her
comfort. After a time, however, he began to pull
at her horns in time with the motion of her
jaws, and this measured movement seemed to annoy
her. Shaking her head, she rose, first behind,
throwing her rider even farther forward than he
was, and then in front, tossing him off altogether.</p>
<p>The distance to the ground was not great, but it
was far enough for Dicky to be peppered with
bumps and pretty well shaken. The cow paid no
farther attention to him but walked off to a spot
where she might be free from annoyance, and the
little boy lay for some time on the ground before
he could pull himself together and go to his grandfather&rsquo;s.
By the time he reached there, his bruises
were already turning black and he was interesting
both to himself and to his relatives, although he was
manfully keeping back his tears. The doctor ordered
him to bed for a day or two, and now he lay
on a cot at one side of the large room which served
as the family hospital, and Ethel Blue at the other,
comparing their wounds, and receiving the attention
of Mrs. Morton. She had finished reading one
of the Br&rsquo;er Rabbit stories to them when Ethel Blue
introduced the subject that was so constantly in her
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I tell you how I happened to fall off the
terrace wall?&rdquo; she asked her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wondered how you did it; you are usually so
sure-footed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was talking with Miss Daisy about my going
to live with Father by-and-by. You know I never
thought of it until the other night when we were all
together on the porch and Helen,&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;said
something about it. I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to
wait to finish school before I can go to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in such a hurry to leave us?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Morton, with a little sigh for the many years of loving
care she had spent over this child, who was to
her like one of her own.</p>
<p>Ethel Blue was conscience-stricken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Aunt Marion, I love all of you just
like my own people. Only it seems so wonderful
to think about being with Father all the time that
I can&rsquo;t get it out of my mind&mdash;now it&rsquo;s in my
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a good many things to be considered,&rdquo;
answered Mrs. Morton. &ldquo;You know that
an officer often has to be away from home and your
father wouldn&rsquo;t like to leave you alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel Blue&rsquo;s face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I only had somebody like Dicky&rsquo;s Mary to
stay with me,&rdquo; she said, referring to the nurse who
had always taken care of Dicky, and who had lived
on with the family after he was too old to need a
nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps your father might marry again and
then there would be no difficulty about your being
with him all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton made the suggestion gently but
Ethel Blue flushed angrily at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a perfectly horrible idea, Aunt
Marion. That means a stepmother for me, and I
think a stepmother is detestable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever known one,&rdquo; inquired Mrs.
Morton coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never have, but I&rsquo;ve read a great deal
about them and they&rsquo;re always cross and mean and
their stepchildren hate them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose that a great many stepchildren
work up a dislike beforehand just because they
read the same kind of stories that you seem to have
been reading?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>Ethel Blue was a reasonable girl, and she thought
this over before she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they do,&rdquo; she said, although slowly, as
if she disliked to admit it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have happened to know several stepmothers,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Morton, &ldquo;and I never have known one
who was not quite as kind or even kinder to her
stepchildren, than to her own children. A mother
feels that she can do as her judgment dictates with
her own children, but with her stepchildren she
weighs everything with even greater care, because
she feels an added responsibility toward them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she can&rsquo;t love them as she does her own
children,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there is very little difference,&rdquo; said her
Aunt Marion. &ldquo;I am not your stepmother but at
the same time I am not your own mother, and I am
not conscious of loving you any less than I love
Ethel Brown. You are both my dear girls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I love Father but I do think Father would be
mean if he gave me a stepmother,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, wouldn&rsquo;t <i>you</i> be mean if you objected to
his having the happiness of a household of his own,
after all these years when he has not had one?&rdquo;
returned Mrs. Morton promptly. &ldquo;Your father
has lived a lonely life for many years, and if such
a thing should happen as his deciding to marry
again, I can&rsquo;t think that my little Ethel Blue would
be so selfish as to make him unhappy&mdash;or even uncomfortable&mdash;about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a new idea for Ethel Blue and she snuggled
down under her covers and turned her head
away to think about it.</p>
<p>Her aunt left her alone and the room was quiet
except for the noise made by Dicky&rsquo;s little hands,
as he turned the pages of a picture book.</p>
<p>It was almost dark when Mrs. Morton came back
with Mary, each of them bearing a tray with the
supper for one of the invalids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Morton, as she entered
the hospital, &ldquo;these are pretty hearty meals
for people who call themselves ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mind isn&rsquo;t ill,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just
these bruises that hurt me,&rdquo; and Dicky understood
what she meant, for he told Mary, who was arranging
his pillows, that his &ldquo;black and blue
thspotth were awful thore,&rdquo; but that he was going
to get up in the morning.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Morton leaned over Ethel Blue&rsquo;s bed,
the young girl put an arm around her aunt&rsquo;s neck
and drew her down to her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind not to be piggy if anything
like that does happen,&rdquo; she said, hesitatingly.
&ldquo;Do you know that it is going to happen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Morton, &ldquo;but I
saw that you were in a frame of mind to make your
father very unhappy if it should come to pass. You
ought not to allow yourself to have such thoughts,
even about an indefinite stepmother. They might
easily turn into thoughts of real hatred for an actual
stepmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you think there <i>might</i> be a stepmother
some time or other?&rdquo; asked Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear, I do. Your father probably seems
old to you, but he really is not very old and, as I
said before, he has lived a lonely life for many
years. You know it was fourteen years ago that
your mother died, and since then he has had no
home of his own and no loving companionship. He
has not even had the delight of helping to bring up
his little daughter. If he can make happiness for
himself now, after all these years, don&rsquo;t you think
that his little daughter ought to help him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel Blue nodded silently and ate her supper
thoughtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>&ldquo;While you two were taking your nap, I went
to Sweetbrier Lodge,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton, by way
of entertaining the invalids. &ldquo;I am so much interested
in the way that Aunt Louise has arranged for
the maids. You know so many people have only
a servant&rsquo;s workroom, the kitchen; and the maids
have no room to sit in after their work is done.
Aunt Louise has been very thoughtful in all her
plans. The laundry and the kitchen and the pantry
between the kitchen and the dining room, all have
the most convenient arrangements possible. Every
shelf and cupboard is placed so that the number of
footsteps that the kitchen worker must take will be
reduced as greatly as possible. Then there are all
sorts of labor saving arrangements. You saw those
in the kitchen and the cellar. The electrician has
been there daily fitting up an electric range and dish-washing
machine. The wires in the kitchen are
placed just where they will be most serviceable, and
there are plenty of windows so that the room is
bright in the day-time. Then just off the kitchen,
there is a delightful little sitting room, with a porch
opening from it. It has a view toward the garden
and FitzJames&rsquo;s woods, and it is to be prettily
furnished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two bed-rooms and a bath for the
maids in the attic story,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;They
are going to be prettily furnished too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will they have a garden?&rdquo; asked Dicky from
his corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know?&rdquo; Mrs. Morton turned to
Ethel for an answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do understand now,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;why
Dorothy insisted on having the herb garden down
by the house. I thought it was just because it would
be convenient to have the herbs near the kitchen, but
she planted flowers there too, and now I see that it
will be a pretty flower garden for the maids to enjoy
and to cut for their own rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There are two things about Aunt Louise that
are interesting,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;One is the way
she always tries to make other people happy and
comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is naturally thoughtful and considerate,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Morton, &ldquo;and she has had much unhappiness
in her life and has happened to meet many
people who are unhappy, so it has taught her to do
all she can to brighten other people&rsquo;s lives and to
make them easier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe many people who are building a
house would let a lot of children say what they
thought would be nice about it,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She wants Dorothy and all of you to learn about
the new ways of building and fitting up a house,&rdquo;
returned Mrs. Morton, &ldquo;and she knows how much
fun it is to talk over such matters in a general pow-wow.
Haven&rsquo;t all of you had a good deal of fun
out of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly have,&rdquo; replied Ethel Blue. &ldquo;I
liked fixing up Ayleesabet&rsquo;s room particularly, because
I suggested the idea, but we have all made
suggestions for every room in the house. Aunt
Louise has not agreed with all of them, but she always
told us why she didn&rsquo;t agree or why she didn&rsquo;t
like our ideas. She never was snippy about it, just
because we were children. The other thing that is
interesting in Aunt Louise, is the way she wants
to have all sorts of new arrangements in a house.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Almost everybody does that,&rdquo; answered Mrs.
Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anybody in Rosemont who has all
the things that Aunt Louise has put in. People
have vacuum cleaners now-a-days, that they move
around from one room to another, but she has hers
built in, so the dirt is drawn right down into the cellar.
She has every kind of electric thing she has
ever heard of, I do believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The electrician was there to-day as I told you,
arranging wires in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was trying to count up as I was lying here, all
the things in the house that go by electricity. Of
course there&rsquo;s the door bell to begin with. Then
there are all the lighting switches&mdash;the one in the
vestibule and all the regular ones in the halls and
rooms and a lot of them in the different closets, so
that she never will have to struggle around in the
dark for anything she is hunting for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a man putting in a little pilot light for the
oven, to-day,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the cook can investigate the state of affairs
in the oven. Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to say how far
along a dish at the back of the oven is. This light
enables you to make out whether it is browning properly
or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who put in the summer water-heater
called the little light that burns all the time in that,
a &lsquo;pilot,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The dumb-waiter that runs from the cellar up
through the house to take up kindling or whatever
needs to be taken up stairs, runs at the touch of an
electric button,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish there had been an elevator for people,&rdquo;
said Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house isn&rsquo;t large enough to call for that,&rdquo;
said her aunt, laughing. &ldquo;Dorothy and her mother
are able to go up one or two flights of stairs without
much suffering!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel laughed at the suggestion, and went on with
her enumeration of the uses of electricity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city water runs into the house, but do you
know that Aunt Louise has had an extra pump fitted
into a deep well at the back of the house, and that
is to work by electricity? She was afraid the house
was so high up that the power of the town water
might be weak sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s prepared for anything, isn&rsquo;t she? She&rsquo;ll
be quite independent if any accident should happen
to the Rosemont reservoir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the fittings of the laundry are electric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the electrician to-day was going to put in
an electric hair dryer in the bath-room, so that a
shampoo will require only a few minutes&rsquo; time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see where all of us girls visit Dorothy on shampoo
day,&rdquo; giggled Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be as popular as I used to be when our
cherries were ripe,&rdquo; her Aunt Marion smiled in return.
&ldquo;I never seemed to have so many friends as
during the June days when I always entertained my
guests by inviting them up into the cherry tree.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Was that the cherry tree on the right thide of
Chrandfather&rsquo;th houthe?&rdquo; asked Dicky suddenly
from the corner where he had been supposed to be
dozing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very same cherry tree, young man. I
dare say you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;th too fat for me to thin up,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
nektht year I&rsquo;m going up on a ladder the minute
I see a robin flying off with the first ripe cherry.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII
<br />A GOLDEN COLOR SCHEME</h2>
<p>When the time came for having the interior
decorating done in Sweetbrier Lodge and
for getting the furniture, the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. felt that they
were really in the very midst of a delightful experience.
The attic was furnished with brown
wicker, as Miss Graham had suggested. A small
upright piano was brought up through a window,
and this pleasant, quiet room at the top of the house,
served to give Dorothy a spot for practising where
she would disturb no one. Up here, too, she could
keep any work that she was doing and merely put
it into a chest that she had prepared for the purpose,
whenever she wanted to leave it, or, if it was
something that could not easily be moved, it might
even be kept out upon the table and there would be
no one to be annoyed by an appearance of untidiness.</p>
<p>The piano was to be a pleasure at the club meetings,
for all the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. members liked to sing, and
Helen was planning that they should wind up every
meeting during the coming winter with a good stirring
chorus before they separated for the afternoon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>On the bedroom floor, the furnishings were carried
out as they had been planned, Elisabeth&rsquo;s room
in blue, Dorothy&rsquo;s in pink, and Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s in
primrose yellow, and the two guest chambers in violet
and a delicate, misty grey. The wood-work was
painted ivory white and the floors were all of hard
wood. Rugs in harmonious tints gave the desirable
depths of tone to the color plan.</p>
<p>On this floor Mrs. Smith had a sewing room and
also a small sitting room, where she could write
business letters and be quite undisturbed. With the
floor below came the really serious work of furnishing,
the girls thought. The drawing room was the
important feature of this floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the family hearth,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith to
Dorothy, &ldquo;and we want to make this room beautiful&mdash;one
that people will like to come into and to
stay in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must not be cold in color, then,&rdquo; said Dorothy.
&ldquo;Nobody likes to stay in a chilly looking room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it ought not to be too warm in color,&rdquo; said
plump little Della, who suffered terribly from the
heat in summer. &ldquo;It just makes me perspire to
<i>think</i> of some of the thick, heavy-looking rooms I&rsquo;ve
been in. They are only suitable for zero weather
and we don&rsquo;t seem to have any more zero weather
nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>Mrs. Smith had allowed Dorothy to ask the club
members to have cocoa with her on the afternoon
when the final decisions were to be made. They
had brought down from up-stairs some of the chairs
and a table which had already been put into the bed-rooms.
Dorothy and the Ethels had made cocoa
and had baked some cocoanut cakes on the new electric
oven, and they were all gathered in the drawing
room, sipping their cocoa and looking about them at
the possibilities of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we begin, tell me how you made these
cakes,&rdquo; said Margaret, who was always adding a
new receipt to her cook book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We took half a pound of dried cocoanut and
two ounces of sugar and three ounces of ground
rice, and mixed them all up together. Then we
beat the whites of three eggs perfectly stiff and
stirred the froth thoroughly into the other things,&rdquo;
said Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we dipped out a tablespoonful at a time
and put it on to a buttered baking tin, and baked
it all in a quick oven for five minutes,&rdquo; said Ethel
Blue, &ldquo;but we didn&rsquo;t take the tin out, right off.
We let the oven cool and the little cakes cook slowly
for half an hour longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do be marvellous good,&rdquo; murmured
James, and all the others agreed with him.</p>
<p>Miss Graham had come over with Margaret and
James, but she said that she was not going to give
her professional advice until it was asked for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may as well tell you first of all,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Smith, &ldquo;what my color scheme is for this room,
and then you can help me with the details. I want
the whole thing to be in tones of brown, lightened
by yellow, and contrasted with that dull blue you
see in Oriental rugs. Now, keep that scheme
of color in your mind and work it out for me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think you must have told the painter about it
before he did the wood-work,&rdquo; guessed Margaret.
&ldquo;This wood-work is white, but a yellowish white
that will be quite in harmony with your brown and
gold scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve caught me,&rdquo; smiled Mrs. Smith. &ldquo;It
had to be done, so I told him what I wanted. It&rsquo;s
successful, don&rsquo;t you think so?&rdquo; she asked, looking
toward Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entirely,&rdquo; approved Miss Daisy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The floors are hard wood, but I suppose you&rsquo;re
going to have a big brown and gold and blue rug,&rdquo;
said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly those colors, if I can find just the
right thing,&rdquo; said her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was with Mother the other day in a rug shop,&rdquo;
said Della, &ldquo;and I saw beautiful Chinese rugs, with
dull blue backgrounds and figures of brown and
tan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;that Oriental rugs
have a great deal of red and green in them. I
should think it might be hard to find rugs with just
brown and blue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have discovered that it is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith,
&ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve already been on one or two searching
trips. Still, those Chinese rugs that Della mentioned
are always available, and if you hunt far
enough you can get others with the brown note uppermost.
What do you think about size?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;I seem to see in my mind&rsquo;s
eye a huge, great, splendid one in the middle of the
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a beautiful rug probably,&rdquo; said
Ethel Brown, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know that I should like
one big fellow as much as two smaller ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I can tell you,&rdquo; answered
Ethel Brown, blushing. &ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s because it
makes the room seem too big and grand, and the
arrangement of smaller ones would break it up into
smaller sections, and make it seem more home-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Daisy nodded as if she were satisfied, but
made no comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do all of you feel about the size of the
rugs?&rdquo; inquired Mrs. Smith, and Helen put the
question to vote.</p>
<p>They decided that they liked the idea of two or
more rugs of medium size with little ones where
they were needed instead of a very large one in the
centre of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith, &ldquo;and I
think that it will be easier to find the smaller ones
than the very large ones&mdash;and less expensive into
the bargain,&rdquo; she said, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the furniture to be?&rdquo; inquired Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy and I had a few antiques that have
been kept for us all these years from my father&rsquo;s
house, and they have given us the note for the rest.
They are mahogany, colonial in style, so we think
that we must make the rest of the furniture harmonize
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Marion told me she saw some lovely reproductions
of truly old chairs and tables and
things,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;I suppose you can make
the room look as if every piece in it was a truly old
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had money enough, I could undoubtedly
find truly old pieces,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith, &ldquo;but I think
I shall content myself with the modern pieces in the
old style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, they will be stronger,&rdquo; said
Margaret. &ldquo;We have some very old furniture,
and since we put steam heat in our house, they&rsquo;ve
been falling to pieces as fast as they could fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are the walls of this room to be treated?&rdquo;
asked James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There I want your help,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a dark brown paper dashed with gold the
other day, on the library wall at Mrs. Schermerhorn&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
said Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too dark,&rdquo; cried the Ethels in chorus. &ldquo;Mrs.
Schermerhorn&rsquo;s wood-work is dark and Aunt Louise&rsquo;s
is almost white.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a kind of Japanese paper that looks like
metal burlap,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;It has a little glint
of gold in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too dark, too, I think,&rdquo; said Dorothy.
&ldquo;It ought to be something that will connect the yellow-white
of the wood-work with the gold, which is
the lightest tone in Mother&rsquo;s color scheme.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>Again Miss Graham nodded her approval, although
she said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a very wide pongee silk the other day
that would be just about the right shade, if it could
be put on like wall-paper,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;It
would be a little darker than this paint, and it would
tie on to the gold in the rug or in any piece of furniture
covering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Miss Graham nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t see why it couldn&rsquo;t be stenciled,&rdquo;
said Ethel Brown. &ldquo;Something like the walls upstairs
in the apple-blossom room, only of course
something that would be appropriate for this room.
But even if you didn&rsquo;t like that idea,&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;I think the pongee silk alone would be beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith liked that idea, too, but she hesitated
to give her final decision until she had examined a
certain homespun linen which she had had recommended
to her as a possible success from the point
of view of color.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that you have finished your cocoa, I want
you to move your chairs over here, where you can
look into the dining room,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You see,
I&rsquo;ve had the dining room separated from this room
by folding doors; there will be door curtains also,
but I want to be able to shut off the room entirely
from this room if I choose. Now, while we talk
about the furniture here, look into the dining room
and get the shape of it into your minds, so that you
can regard it as a sort of outgrowth of this room.
Are you comfortable now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>They said they were and went on to discuss the
furniture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will all of the pieces be upholstered with the
same material?&rdquo; asked Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; cried Ethel Brown. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have two
or three different shades of brown, and one in the
right shade of yellow and one or two in the same
dull blue of the rug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Miss Graham nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to repeat in the furniture the colors
of the rug,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They give you a wide
range of tones because these Oriental rugs may have
as many as twenty-five shades of blue, so finely
graduated that you can hardly tell them apart, except
with a reading glass. The brown and gold of
the furniture will bring out the brown and gold
of the floor covering and you must be careful that
the yellow of the furniture is not so brilliant as to
overpower the more delicate yellow of your walls.
There should be a sort of scale from the yellowish
white wood-work which is your highest note, down
to the darkest shade of brown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, that we&rsquo;ve decided about the furniture,
tell me what general idea you have for the dining
room,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all excitement to
hear what you have to say about the dining room,
because it isn&rsquo;t quite clear in my own mind, and I
want to work it out with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want it to be an outgrowth of this room,&rdquo;
said Helen, &ldquo;and you don&rsquo;t want it treated like an
entirely separate room.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Since it is connected with this room by so wide
an opening, when the doors are drawn back,&rdquo; said
her aunt, &ldquo;it seems to me as if it ought to be in
harmony with the coloring here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all agreed with this idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suggest,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;that the whole
room might be a little darker than this room, although
decorated with the same colors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Graham again approved this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has the morning sun,&rdquo; said Dorothy, &ldquo;and at
night through most of the year the gas is lighted at
dinner time so it isn&rsquo;t necessary to have it so bright
as the other room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not have everything the same, except
just a little deeper in tone,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.
&ldquo;Have the wood-work a trifle darker and find some
material for the walls or have them color-washed a
few shades darker than the pongee. The floor is
a little darker than this anyway and one of the
darker blue Chinese rugs will be lovely on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s china is blue Canton,&rdquo; said Dorothy.
&ldquo;That will give blue touch that will harmonize with
the rugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were all pleased with their decisions and
were greatly pleased when Miss Graham approved
their wisdom.</p>
<p>The electricians had put in the electric fixtures
and they noticed that the dining room side lights
of both the dining room and drawing room looked
like sconces; that there was a glowing bowl of light
in the ceiling above the dinner table; and that the
half concealed lights were to give a pleasant radiance
in the larger room, while plugs around the wall permitted
the use of electric lamps for reading or sewing
at many different points.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How is this little reception room to be done,
Mrs. Smith?&rdquo; asked James as he roamed into a
small room just beside the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This whole floor, all in all, is to have the same
color scheme,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smith. &ldquo;I think this and
the hall will be done like the dining room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out now, and see the maid&rsquo;s sitting
room,&rdquo; cried Dorothy. &ldquo;It is the cunningest thing
and so pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wicker furniture had already come for this
room and the attic, and they all exclaimed at the
delicate shade of gray rattan which made a charming
back-ground for cushions of flowered chintz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a dear duck of a room!&rdquo; said Ethel
Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see the roses on the walls!&rdquo; exclaimed
Dorothy. &ldquo;And it opens on to a little porch that
is going to be covered with rambler roses all summer,
if I can possibly make them grow and blossom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many of you people can go to the Metropolitan
Museum with me on Saturday?&rdquo; asked
Miss Graham. &ldquo;I know you younger ones are all
busy in school now, and the boys are getting ready
to go to college, so that is your only day, for we
want plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>There was not one of them who could not go, so
they arranged about trains and where they should
pick up the Watkinses in New York, and separated
with pleasant expectations of the very good time
ahead of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV
<br />AT THE METROPOLITAN</h2>
<p>Dicky, the Honorary Member of the United
Service Club, had been considered too young
to become a member of the party to visit the Metropolitan
Museum. He had, however, begged so
hard not to be left behind, that Helen and Roger
had relented, and had promised to take him if he,
in his turn, would agree not to bother Miss Graham
by asking more than a million questions every
ten minutes. He was also under bond not to stray
away from the party.</p>
<p>As it turned out, however, the Honorary Member
did not go to New York on the appointed day. He
had planned an expedition of his own for purposes
of investigation, and the results were such that he
was not able to meet his other engagement later on.</p>
<p>Underneath his bobbed hair Dicky kept a sharp
pair of ears and there was very little of the talk
about his aunt&rsquo;s new house that had escaped his attention.
Among other things he had listened while
his sisters and cousins had commented upon the manner
in which the kitchen was equipped. The floor
was concrete, the walls were of white tile, the shelves
were of glass, and the cupboard doors of enameled
metal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>He had heard his mother say to his Aunt Louise:
&ldquo;Why, you could turn the hose on it to clean it,
couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea had inflamed his imagination and he determined
to see how it would work. Detaching the
hose and spray from the bath-room he trotted off
immediately after breakfast, intent on putting into
effect his mother&rsquo;s idea. It seemed to him that it
would be a delight to live in a house where one might
enter into the kitchen at any moment and find the
cook spraying the walls with a hose. If the reality
proved to be as charming as the anticipation, he
was going to beg his mother to have their own
kitchen made over promptly.</p>
<p>The workmen were all upstairs at Sweetbrier
Lodge but the lower doors were open so that there
was no difficulty in achieving an entrance. He
knew how to attach the spray to the faucet and a
twist of the fingers turned on the water.</p>
<p>It seemed to him as the first dash struck him full
in the face, he having been a little careless about
the nozzle, that his Aunt Louise need not have worried
about the pressure of the town water. He
shook his head like a pussy cat in the rain, but manfully
restrained the ejaculation that leaped to his
lips. He was glad that he did, because nobody interrupted
and the succeeding moments were filled
with ecstasy. He sprayed the floor, the electric
range, the shiny white table, the glistening cupboards,
and, best of all, the gleaming tiles of the
walls down which the drops chased each other in a
joyous race for the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>The moments sped in this entrancing pursuit.</p>
<p>At home a cry for Dicky had arisen as the time
came to dress him for his trip to New York. Nobody
knew where he had gone. It was not until
Ethel Brown telephoned to Dorothy that they
learned that he had been seen passing her house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have gone to Sweetbrier Lodge for
some reason or other,&rdquo; said Ethel Brown. &ldquo;What
on earth possessed him on this morning of all mornings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She called to Roger, and he dashed off on the run
to see if he could find his wandering brother. None
of the workmen at the new house had any knowledge
of his whereabouts, and it was not until Roger
opened one of the carefully closed doors and was
greeted by a dash of water, straight in his waistcoat,
that he found the wanderer.</p>
<p>Roger was a boy of even temper but he confessed
to his mother afterwards that his fingers ached as
never before to impress on Dicky his disapproval of
his occupation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth are you doing here?&rdquo; he demanded,
snatching the hose from Dicky&rsquo;s reluctant
fingers, and turning off the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Washing down the walls,&rdquo; replied Dicky truthfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Incidentally you&rsquo;ve given yourself a good soaking,&rdquo;
said Roger, looking at the thoroughly drenched
little figure before him. &ldquo;Here, slip into this coat,
and I hope I haven&rsquo;t got to carry you home the whole
way, you big, heavy creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;d be warmer if I trotted myself,&rdquo; suggested
Dicky, a little apprehensive of what might
happen to him in the way of a bear hug, in his brother&rsquo;s
strong arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said Roger. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have to run like deer, for it&rsquo;s almost time for the car
to come for us. This puts an end to your going
into town, I suppose you understand, young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky had not thought of losing his other joy
while he was realizing his first delight, and he puckered
his face for a howl, but before the sound could
come out, Roger said: &ldquo;You brought it on to yourself,
so don&rsquo;t yell. This is the natural result of what
you&rsquo;ve been doing. You can&rsquo;t expect ten people to
wait for you to be thoroughly dried and got ready to
go into town, can you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dicky was an uncommonly reasonable child and
he swallowed his sobs as he shook his head. There
was no farther conversation, for both boys were running
as fast as Roger&rsquo;s legs could set the pace.
Dicky&rsquo;s strides were assisted by his brother, who
seized his arm and helped him over the ground with
giant steps.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morton&rsquo;s view of the situation seemed to
be painfully like Roger&rsquo;s, and Dicky found himself
put into the care of Mary and an unnaturally rough
bath towel, his only part in the expedition that had
promised such happiness to him, being the sight of
his relatives climbing into his grandfather&rsquo;s automobile
and dashing off toward Glen Point, where they
were to pick up Miss Graham and the Hancocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>When the party reached New York they made up
their minds that they might as well approach the
Museum containing many beautiful objects by the
prettiest way possible, so at 59th Street the car
swept into Central Park. As they entered, Miss
Graham called their attention to the golden statue
of General Sherman, made by the famous sculptor,
Saint-Gaudens. As they neared the Museum, she
pointed out Cleopatra&rsquo;s needle, an Egyptian shaft
covered with hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor old stone has had a hard time in this
climate,&rdquo; said Roger. &ldquo;It has scaled off terribly,
hasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are trying to preserve it by a preparation
of parafine,&rdquo; said Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it would have to be repeated
every winter,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem as if
parafine was much of a protection against heavy
frost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just inside the entrance of the building they found
Della and Tom awaiting them. Miss Graham
called their attention first to the tapestries hanging
in the entrance hall, and told them something of the
patient work that went into the production of one
of these great sheets of painstaking embroidery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they making them anywhere, nowadays?&rdquo;
asked Ethel Blue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When the war is over and you go to Paris, you
can see the tapestry workers in the Gobelins factory,&rdquo;
said Miss Daisy. &ldquo;Every machine has hung
upon it the picture which the worker is copying. It
may take a man six or seven years to complete one
piece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you think he would be sick to death of
it!&rdquo; exclaimed Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the first year he tells himself he must
be pleasant, so that he will see the picture get
started. In the second year perhaps he&rsquo;ll be ready
to put in the feet of his figures. Then all the middle
years must be comparatively exciting because
he&rsquo;s doing the central part of the picture; and the
last year he has a sort of a thrill because it&rsquo;s almost
done, even though the work may be all in the
clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I judge that they make landscapes with figures,
chiefly,&rdquo; guessed James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many of them are landscapes with figures,&rdquo; replied
Miss Daisy. &ldquo;They have a wide variety of
objects. The factory belongs to the government
and the pieces are used as decorations for government
buildings, and as gifts to people of other countries.
The French Government gave Miss Alice
Roosevelt a piece of Gobelin when she was married.
I&rsquo;ve seen it on exhibition in the Art Museum at Cincinnati.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose all the workmen now have gone to
the war, and the factory is closed,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. The men who work there now are
descendants, sometimes in the third or fourth generation,
of the early workers. They hold their positions
for life and although their pay is not large
they also have each a cottage and piece of land on
the grounds of the factory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. ascended the great stair-way they
passed numerous impressive busts and stopped to
look at all of them. Most of the men were famous
Americans, whose names were already familiar to
the young people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Miss Graham, as they reached the
head of the stairs, &ldquo;later on we can choose the kind
of thing we would like especially to see, but first I
want to show you two or three pictures and we can
talk a little about them. Then perhaps we will enjoy
better the pictures we see afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure we shall,&rdquo; answered Roger, politely,
although his heart was yearning for the Riggs collection
of armor.</p>
<p>Miss Daisy read his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you want to see the Riggs armor most
of all,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and Margaret and James have
been talking a lot about the Morgan collection and
the Ethels told me on the way in that they had seen
in the Sunday papers reproductions of some of the
pictures in the Altman collections and they want to
see the originals. We can see all those later on,
but first we will look for a minute at a very famous
picture by a Frenchwoman, Rosa Bonheur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I remember about her,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;She
used to wear men&rsquo;s clothes when she was working in
her studio. She said skirts bothered her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should think they would,&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;I remember
about her, too. She made a specialty of
animals and sometimes she had lions and other wild
animals from some Zoo, and let them wander about.
She needed to be dressed so she could skip lively if
they made any demonstration!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are huge horses, aren&rsquo;t they,&rdquo; said Ethel
Blue, as they stood before the &ldquo;Horse Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look as if they were &lsquo;feeling gayly,&rsquo; as the
North Carolina mountaineers say,&rdquo; quoted Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it all about?&rdquo; asked Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Ethel Blue
slowly. &ldquo;Is it about anything in particular? Isn&rsquo;t
it just a lot of horses being taken to a Horse Fair
for exhibition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Graham nodded and said that that was probably
all there was to it. Then she led them to a
picture by a French artist, Meissonier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spot Napoleon,&rdquo; said Tom promptly, as they
took up their position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is called &lsquo;Friedland, 1807,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Miss
Graham.</p>
<p>Before she could ask any question or make any
suggestion about the picture, Helen had explained
&ldquo;Friedland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was one of Napoleon&rsquo;s famous battles.
Here he defeated the Russians and Prussians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eighteen hundred and seven?&rdquo; repeated James.
&ldquo;Why, Napoleon was at the very height of his
power then, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He looks it,&rdquo; said Margaret. &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he
look as if he were the lord of the world? And how
those men around him gaze at him with adoration!
He certainly had a wonderful ability for making himself
beloved by his soldiers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Graham had been listening to these comments
with the greatest interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What difference do you see between this picture
and the &lsquo;Horse Fair&rsquo;?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>They looked carefully at the picture before them
and Ethel Blue scampered back to refresh her
memory on the &ldquo;Horse Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any more action in one than the
other,&rdquo; said James, &ldquo;though, of course, it&rsquo;s different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this one makes me think a lot about a great
man,&rdquo; added his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want to know what it&rsquo;s all about,&rdquo; exclaimed
Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feel as if there must be some story about
this one,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue, returning from her expedition
to the &ldquo;Horse Fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the point,&rdquo; said Miss Graham, patting
her shoulder, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no especial appeal to
the imagination in the &lsquo;Horse Fair.&rsquo; You just see
horses going to any horse fair in northern France,
and there&rsquo;s nothing to tell you that one horse has won
a ploughing match and that another is a candidate for
a blue ribbon because of his great weight. But here
you realize at once that Napoleon was a man to command
attention. You want to know what he has
been doing. You feel that there is some good reason
for the evident admiration of his soldiers.
Those two pictures are examples of two different
classes of pictures. The &lsquo;Horse Fair&rsquo; you might
call a sketch in a traveller&rsquo;s note book. The Napoleon
picture is an illustration in a story.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>The young people thought over all this and
nodded their agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now come with me and see this picture of a
pretty girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Graham led the way to the Morgan collection
and they looked into the winning face of &ldquo;Miss
Farren.&rdquo; She seemed to be moving swiftly across
the canvas, her dress and cloak streaming behind her
from the speed of her motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a pretty girl,&rdquo; said Roger, with his hand
on his heart. Tom nodded in agreement, but James
shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looks silly,&rdquo; he said sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any story to her picture, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo;
said Helen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a portrait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But may not a portrait indicate something of the
character of the sitter?&rdquo; asked Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ought to,&rdquo; returned Margaret, &ldquo;and I should
think there was something of this girl&rsquo;s character in
the portrait, but there&rsquo;s nothing to show that this
might be the illustration of a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless it were the frontispiece, showing the picture
of the heroine,&rdquo; said Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the heroine doing nothing that is told about
in the story,&rdquo; insisted Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>Miss Graham made no comment on these criticisms
but led the way to another picture, also of a
girl, but this time of a girl in the dress of a peasant
and not handsomely arrayed as was Miss Farren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a bigger difference than clothes between
these two,&rdquo; said Della, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know just what
it is. This girl isn&rsquo;t pretty like Miss Farren.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who this is?&rdquo; asked Miss Daisy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody who is thinking a lot,&rdquo; said Ethel
Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is seeing things in her mind,&rdquo; said Ethel
Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is the most famous girl in history, who did
that?&rdquo; asked Miss Graham.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;She saw visions
that inspired her to be a leader of men in the army
and she brought about the coronation of her king
when he was kept from his throne by the English
who held Paris and a large part of France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is seeing visions now,&rdquo; whispered Ethel
Blue, clinging to Miss Graham&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>Miss Graham gently smoothed the fingers that
were tensely closed over the sleeve of her jacket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose Helen told us about Jeanne
d&rsquo;Arc just now?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Helen just naturally knows all the history
there is to be known,&rdquo; said Roger, joking his
sister in brotherly fashion.</p>
<p>Helen flushed and murmured something that
sounded like, &ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d like to know why
she looked like that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There is something more than just her character
and her disposition in that picture,&rdquo; said Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a single picture can be a story picture, I
should think this was a story picture as much as the
Napoleon one,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>Again Miss Daisy nodded her approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call it a story picture,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Helen
felt that it was, immediately, and that is why she
told us something of the story of Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most landscapes must be just note book pictures,
then,&rdquo; guessed Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless the landscape should be a background
for some story,&rdquo; said Della. &ldquo;There might be gypsies
kidnapping a child, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course there are other divisions,&rdquo; said Miss
Graham, &ldquo;but roughly speaking, almost every picture
is either a record of fact or of imagination, or
else it tells a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be interesting to think about that,
when we look at the other pictures we shall see later
on,&rdquo; said Tom, and even Roger nodded assent, although
his heart was still set upon the armor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, let&rsquo;s go back for a moment to look at the
&lsquo;Horse Fair,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Miss Graham. &ldquo;What do
you think a picture ought to have in it to be a real
picture?&rdquo; she asked as they went along the gallery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that a picture that is nothing but
a record, as you said a few minutes ago, can&rsquo;t be
much of a picture,&rdquo; said Roger. &ldquo;I should want
something more in a picture, something that would
stir me up. Why, even Miss Farren&rsquo;s there isn&rsquo;t
exactly a record, because you have something more
than just eyes and nose and hair. She looks as
if she would be fun to talk to, and as for the &lsquo;Horse
Fair,&rsquo; which was the other picture that we decided
was a record, why that has in it more than just a lot
of horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Rosa Bonheur had wanted merely to draw
some horses, she might have strung them along in
a row so that we could get an idea of their size and
color and could make a guess at their weight, but
here we see them in action and we know that they
are in good spirits and we feel some sympathy with
the men who have a hard time to hold them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that picture stirs me a little, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because both &lsquo;Miss Farren&rsquo; and the
&lsquo;Horse Fair&rsquo; are real pictures. Any picture that
tries to be more than merely a photographic reproduction
must stir your emotions in one way or another,&rdquo;
said Miss Daisy. &ldquo;Now as we look at this
picture, do you think the artist put into it everything
that she saw on the road that morning when
she passed this group of men and horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say not,&rdquo; said Della, &ldquo;because there
would be likely to be dogs and boys with the
men, and perhaps some ugly houses in the background.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you suppose she didn&rsquo;t put everything
in?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, a picture ought to try to be beautiful,
oughtn&rsquo;t it, and some of those things might be ugly,
or there might be so many of them that it would be
confusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are both good reasons,&rdquo; said Miss Daisy.
&ldquo;They both show that the artist has to <i>select</i> the
things that he thinks will be of the greatest interest
to the people who look at his pictures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now when he has picked them out, what should
you say the next step was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were all rather blank at this question but
after a while Roger said slowly, &ldquo;Evidently she
picked out just so many as being the best looking
ones to put in the picture; and she didn&rsquo;t like them
all facing the audience, ready to bob their heads at
you as you look at them; she made them trot along
the road in a natural way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; approved Miss Graham. &ldquo;She <i>arranged</i>
what she had selected so that they would be
natural and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so that the colors would show well?&rdquo; asked
Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, so that there would be contrasts of color
that would be pleasing to the eye. Then there
should be <i>balance</i>. Have you any idea what that
means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you haven&rsquo;t all noticed a Japanese
print that Margaret has?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the one with big green leaves up in
one corner and the grasshopper clinging to a tendril?&rdquo;
asked Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one,&rdquo; returned Miss Daisy. &ldquo;Did
it ever occur to you that those leaves were all
crowded off into one corner of the picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought of it,&rdquo; said Margaret, &ldquo;and I
have looked at it every day for a year. They are,
aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it didn&rsquo;t affect you unpleasantly, did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no. I think it&rsquo;s a pretty picture,&rdquo; said
Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; agreed Miss Graham; &ldquo;but what device
did the artist use to make you feel comfortable about
it, and to make you forget that he had put a bunch
of foliage up in one corner and had left more than
one-half of his sheet blank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody could answer this question and Miss Graham
had to give the explanation herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a question of balance,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The
great mass of white paper in the lower right hand
part of the picture balances the mass of green leaves
in the upper left hand corner. The green is a
heavier looking color than the white, and it therefore
takes a larger amount of white to balance the
green. The Japanese who made this painting understood
that, and he has so arranged his leaves and
his grasshopper, that the eye is entirely pleased by
the balance that results. If Rosa Bonheur has managed
wisely there should be masses of light and dark,
balancing each other, and there should be spaces and
solids, balancing each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has she done it? It doesn&rsquo;t worry me any,&rdquo;
said Roger. &ldquo;I think she must have succeeded.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Keeping Miss Graham&rsquo;s explanation in mind they
took another look at the Napoleon picture and concluded
that Meissonier also knew what he was
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Composition&rsquo; means the putting together of
a picture, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked Helen. &ldquo;I should
think that the composition of a picture that has so
many figures, must be extremely difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far more difficult, of course, than one for which
the artist has selected fewer objects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And of two artists producing complicated pictures
like these, he is the better who gives an effect
of simplicity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose that Rosa Bonheur had noticed that
one of the men struggling with the horses had his
face bound up with a cloth; does that have anything
to do with the picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all agreed that it had not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she was perfectly right to leave out any
object that would distract the observer&rsquo;s mind. She
put into this picture of horses going to the horse
fair only such things as would make the onlooker
think of the beauty and spirit of the horses as shown
by their handsome coats and by the difficulty which
the men had in controlling them, and his imagination
would be stirred to wonder as to which of these
fine animals was to win a prize. Everything which
might compete with these simple ideas the artist left
out of the picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been awfully hard to do such a lot
of legs,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue, who knew a little about
drawing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;An artist has to know a good deal about anatomy,&rdquo;
returned Miss Graham. &ldquo;He must know
how the human body is made, and the horse&rsquo;s body,
too, if he is to do a picture like this, and he even
must know something about the under-structure of
the earth. He must make the lines of those legs
all move harmoniously. Look at this Napoleon picture
once more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again they stood before &ldquo;Friedland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were to prolong the up-standing lines of
weapons and helmets you would find that they were
parallel or tended toward some point possibly outside
of the picture. Unless an appearance of confusion
is desired it would not do to have lines leading
in every direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would make a picture look every which way,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention to such points as this helps to give
expression to the whole picture,&rdquo; went on Miss
Daisy. &ldquo;Not only do the figures in the pictures
have their own expression, but the picture as a whole
may wear an expression of peace, like that quiet
landscape over there; or of confusion, like this picture
of the attempted assassination of a pope, or of
orderly excitement, like that cavalry charge yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they turned from one canvas to another the
Club realized the truth of what Miss Graham was
saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a fact, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; agreed Tom. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t have to see the look on the fellows&rsquo; faces to
get the general effect of the picture even from a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been talking so much about color schemes
in connection with Dorothy&rsquo;s new house, that I am
sure the phrase is familiar to you,&rdquo; said Miss Graham.
&ldquo;Look at the color schemes of these pictures
around us. Do you see that there are no discords
because a color note is struck and all of the
other shades and colors harmonize with it? That
battle rush, for instance, is a study in red. Compare
that with the dull misty blues, greens, and greys
in LePage&rsquo;s &lsquo;Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went from one picture to another and proved
the truth of this statement to their satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll call our lesson done,&rdquo; said Miss Graham.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have some luncheon downstairs and
when we come up we can let Roger have his heart&rsquo;s
desire, and we&rsquo;ll give the afternoon to looking at
the Morgan and Altman and Riggs collections of
wonders. I doubt if there was ever gathered together
anywhere three such groups. The Altman
pictures are choice, the Riggs armor is unequalled
anywhere in the world, and the Morgan collection is
the finest general collection ever owned by a private
individual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a weary but a happy party that returned to
Rosemont in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of these days is awfully hard on your
head,&rdquo; confessed Roger, as he was talking to his
mother about the Club&rsquo;s experience, &ldquo;but it certainly
is good for your gray matter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to remember whenever we look at
pictures again,&rdquo; said Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there are lots of things in it that we shall
think about when we look over the decorating in our
house,&rdquo; insisted Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I thought was the nicest of all was the
way Miss Graham taught us. It was just like talking.
I think she is awfully nice,&rdquo; was Ethel Blue&rsquo;s
decision.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV
<br />PREPARATIONS FOR THE HOUSEWARMING</h2>
<p>The trip to the Metropolitan Museum gave
every member of the party a new set of words
for her vocabulary. They looked at pictures with
opened eyes and talked of their &ldquo;composition&rdquo; and
&ldquo;balance.&rdquo; They were all of them more or less
interested in photography and now they tried to take
photographs that would be real pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t so easy to make a picture by selecting
what you want to have and leaving out the things
you don&rsquo;t want,&rdquo; said Roger to Helen one morning
as they walked toward Sweetbrier Lodge, &ldquo;when
the things are right there in the landscape and won&rsquo;t
get out of the camera&rsquo;s way. A painter would leave
out that stupid old wooden house in the field there,
but he&rsquo;d leave in the splendid elm bending over it.
Now if I &lsquo;shoot&rsquo; the elm I&rsquo;ve got to &lsquo;shoot&rsquo; the
house, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only way out is to take the house at some
angle that will show off any good points it may
have,&rdquo; declared Helen, wrinkling a puzzled brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then as likely as not you&rsquo;ll have to take the
tree on the side where the lightning hit it and peeled
off all its bark,&rdquo; growled her brother gloomily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That just shows that a photographer has to be
more skilful than a painter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The
painter can do what he likes, but the photographer
has to get good results out of what is set before
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for balance&mdash;if nature happens to have
placed things in balance, well and good; but if she
didn&rsquo;t what can you do about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my child, unless you introduce some
object that you have some power over. Put in a
girl or a dog or a horse somewhere where their
weight will bring about the result you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t carry girls and dogs and horses round
with you,&rdquo; objected Roger, who was in a depressed
mood this morning and found difficulties in every
suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got enough sisters and cousins for the
girls, and you can take Christopher Columbus
around with you in your pocket to play the four-footed
friend,&rdquo; laughed Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of Columbus&mdash;are we going to celebrate
Columbus Day this year?&rdquo; asked Roger, as
he deftly inserted a new spool of film. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just
luck James and I being here at all, you know.
We&rsquo;d like to do something to celebrate being exposed
to scarlet fever as soon as we got to Boston,
and being sent home for it to incubate, and then
having nothing hatch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard? Aunt Louise is going to
have her housewarming on October 12, Columbus
Day? She has asked the Club to do something appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the Watkinses had asked us to go into
New York to see the parade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have. That won&rsquo;t interfere with us.
They&rsquo;ll come out here later and then we&rsquo;ll do something
in the evening in the new attic to amuse Aunt
Louise&rsquo;s guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any idea what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea in the back of my head. I&rsquo;ll
have to talk it over first with the girls to see if we
can manage the costumes. If we can I think it will
be mighty pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger nodded absent-mindedly. He had perfect
confidence in his sister&rsquo;s good judgment and he was
willing to do his part for his aunt&rsquo;s sake as well as
for the good name of the Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you taking?&rdquo; Helen asked him after
they had roamed about the new place for a time.
&ldquo;You seem to be using a lot of film.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. I thought I&rsquo;d take the new house and
garden from every point of view I could, inside and
out, and make two or three portfolios of them and
send them to Father and Uncle Richard, as they&rsquo;d
probably like to have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a perfectly darling idea! Isn&rsquo;t Aunt
Louise delighted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to be,&rdquo; returned Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew she had asked Uncle Richard to come
up for her house-warming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, too; but it&rsquo;s dollars to doughnuts they
won&rsquo;t be able to come, so I thought I&rsquo;d do these any
way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Father won&rsquo;t be able to, but Uncle Richard
may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be glad to have the prints even if he has
seen the original places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he&rsquo;ll like them better on that account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I should. It would be like having your
memory illustrated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to do the rockery in the garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the frost has left anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be placed in just the right spot for
there&rsquo;s a lot of it left. I passed it early to-day and
it looked almost as pretty as if it were summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy certainly made a success of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an afterthought, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the chief reason it has been so lovely
is that it was placed in a natural position. The
rocks look as if they ought to be just where they
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Schermerhorn&rsquo;s rockery looks as if she had
said, &lsquo;Lo, I&rsquo;ll have a rockery,&rsquo; and then she stuck it
right in the middle of her lawn where no collection
of rocks has been for twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she has hot-house ferns in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brother and sister laughed delightedly at
their neighbor&rsquo;s ideas of natural beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was fortunate that Dorothy didn&rsquo;t
have a hot-house to draw on,&rdquo; said Roger, moving
from one side to another of his cousin&rsquo;s rockery in
order to get the best view of its remaining loveliness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy has too much sense. In the first place
she snuggled hers in here under the trees, just the
way the rocks are naturally over in FitzJames&rsquo;s
Woods. Then she brought over here exactly the
plants she found there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had to look as if it were a bit of the woods,
didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to be in this picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look too dressed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you! This is a middy I&rsquo;ve worn all
summer, and I&rsquo;m just wearing out the rags of it on
Saturdays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, you dazzle me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a polite way of saying you don&rsquo;t want me
in the foreground. You&rsquo;d better put in what Miss
Daisy calls &lsquo;contemporaneous human interest.&rsquo;
I&rsquo;m a great addition to any picture in which I appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are, ma&rsquo;am, of course,&rdquo; replied Roger with
exaggerated politeness, &ldquo;but I think I&rsquo;d like you
under an arbor in a graceful attitude and not hobnobbing
with these wild flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that wild flowers have been my special
care this summer,&rdquo; returned Helen, withdrawing
to a point where she would not interfere with
Roger&rsquo;s plans. &ldquo;Dorothy&rsquo;s wild garden is only a
copy of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in arrangement. Hers is prettier with
everything piled up on the stones this way&mdash;columbines,
ferns, wild ginger, hepaticas.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right about that. Mine had to be in a
regular bed. Are you going to take a picture of the
vegetable garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I am. And of tomatoes that were
started with and without dirt bands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roger&rsquo;s chief attention during the summer garden
campaign had been devoted to the raising of vegetables,
while the girls had done wonders with flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are dirt bands?&rdquo; inquired Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; cried the voice of Ethel Brown who
came in sight through the pergola. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
brown paper cuffs to put around young plants. It
keeps the earth all close and cozy and warm and
they grow faster than the ones that don&rsquo;t wear such
fine clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to that,&rdquo; Roger said approvingly to
Helen. &ldquo;Those Ethels haven&rsquo;t let anything slip
that happened in any of our gardens all summer.
They know all about everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger is in a very complimentary mood this
morning,&rdquo; laughed Helen. &ldquo;If I could only think
of something to say I&rsquo;d be polite in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry it doesn&rsquo;t come to you spontaneously,&rdquo;
replied her brother, &ldquo;but what care I?&rdquo; and he
broke into song:</p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t">When the earth is hoed up to my stem.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oo-hoo!&rdquo; came a voice from the Lodge.
&ldquo;Come in and help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Dorothy calling,&rdquo; cried Ethel Brown,
and they all moved toward the house where they
found their cousin on the back porch with an array of
plates, bowls, stones, small plants, tiny trees and
small china figures before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I inquire, madam, what on earth&mdash;&rdquo; began
Roger, but Ethel Brown&rsquo;s exclamation enlightened
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re making Japanese gardens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try to. I think they&rsquo;re awfully
pretty and cunning. Let&rsquo;s each make one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith had bought a professionally made
garden at an Oriental shop in New York, and the
girls were seized with a desire to copy it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the real thing,&rdquo; and Dorothy indicated
a flat bowl of gray and dull green pottery. In it
were some stones outlining the bed of a stream over
which stretched the span of a tiny porcelain bridge.
A twisted tree that looked aged in spite of its height
of only three inches reared its evergreen head at
one end of the bridge; a patch of grass the size of
three fingers grew greenly at the other end, and a
goldfish swam happily in a pool at the side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Margaret told me that horse-radish would grow
if you kept it damp and let it sprout, so I&rsquo;ve got several
pieces started for our gardens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, the horse-radish had sent forth
shoots and a head of small leaves quite tall enough
for the size of the garden, and its body looked
brownish and gnarled like some bit of queer Oriental
wood. Dorothy had taken up little plants of running
growth like partridge berry and she had collected
many wee ferns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can sprinkle a pinch or two of grass seed
and bird seed over them all when they&rsquo;re done,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;That ought to bring up something fresh
every little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These will be all started for your housewarming,&rdquo;
suggested Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m doing them. We can leave
them here, and I&rsquo;ll come over every day so they&rsquo;ll be
watered. I think they&rsquo;ll be awfully pretty and
they&rsquo;ll be different from the usual decorations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I read somewhere the other day that the Japs
arrange their flowers with a meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, they do,&rdquo; cried Dorothy. &ldquo;They have very
little in one holder, perhaps only three flowers.
One&mdash;the highest one&mdash;means Heaven, the next
lower is Man, and the lowest is Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have to have a diagram with every
vase,&rdquo; insisted Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water in the bowl that holds the flowers
represents the surface of the earth and the edge of
the bowl is the horizon. Then they have ways of
suggesting the different seasons&mdash;spring by flowers,
summer by a lot of green leaves, autumn by bright
colored leaves and winter by tall stems without much
on them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got flowers left in the gardens&mdash;lots of
them,&rdquo; insisted Ethel Brown proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty,&rdquo; answered Dorothy; &ldquo;and by this time
next year I hope we&rsquo;ll have a little hot-house of our
own so that we can have flowering plants all winter,
but I like other things, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Daisy was telling me the other day that
we Americans didn&rsquo;t pay enough attention to using
through the winter branches of trees and seedling
trees from the woods and boughs of pine and fir and
cedar,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue, who came through the house
and had been listening to the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you couldn&rsquo;t have a small maple-tree
growing all winter in the dining-room if you
put your mind on it,&rdquo; answered Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great jar of Norway spruce with cones hanging
from the fingers would be stunning,&rdquo; decided
Roger, as he set his horse-radish in place and planted
a tree at one end of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The covers for the radiators are all on now,&rdquo;
said Dorothy, changing the subject. &ldquo;Did you notice
them when you came through the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ethels had not and Helen and Roger had
gone directly to the garden, so they all went in on a
tour of examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother said that there was one thing about
heating that she couldn&rsquo;t stand, and that was the ugly
radiators; so the heating man has tried to hide them
as much as he could. There isn&rsquo;t one in the house
that stands out like a monument of pipes,&rdquo; declared
Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even in the attic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even in the attic. See, he&rsquo;s covered most
of them with grilles bronzed or painted like the
wood-work of the room, so they aren&rsquo;t at all conspicuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s these little points that make this house so
attractive,&rdquo; declared Helen. &ldquo;Aunt Louise has
thought of everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to wear at the party?&rdquo;
asked Ethel Blue of Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we do that Columbus thing&mdash;&rdquo; began Dorothy,
looking at Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; the president of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. replied
to the inquiring gaze; &ldquo;we might as well tell Roger
now as later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we have the tableaux and pantomimes we can
stay in our court dresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Court dresses?&rdquo; inquired Roger, sitting up interestedly.
&ldquo;Why so scrumptious?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Columbus at the court of Ferdinand and Isabella,&rdquo;
answered Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You as Columbus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me? Me? Why this honor?&rdquo; asked Roger
meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need you ask?&rdquo; returned Helen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s in
reply to your remarks about me as an addition to the
foreground of your photographs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Even. I don&rsquo;t care what I do as long as I have
time to get it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have plenty of time,&rdquo; promised Dorothy.
&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m more interested in just now is
what we&rsquo;re to have to eat on the festive night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Aunt Louise going to let us decide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Subject to her veto, I suspect,&rdquo; smiled Helen.</p>
<p>Dorothy nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says she wants something different from ice-cream
and cake and chicken salad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed, for Rosemont was noted for invariably
having these three excellent but monotonous
viands at all her teas and receptions and church entertainments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I move we have cold turkey,&rdquo; said Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather early for turks, but we can have
capon if we can&rsquo;t find a good turkey,&rdquo; replied Ethel
Brown, who kept the run of the Rosemont market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have little birds in aspic jelly,&rdquo; suggested
Dorothy.</p>
<p>They all gurgled with pleasure at this idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squabs,&rdquo; went on Dorothy as her imagination
began to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; commented Roger, his eyes shut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Split them down the back, dip them into beaten
egg and melted butter, sprinkle them with the finest
bread crumbs and broil them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; came a gentle murmur from Roger, who
was deeply affected by the recital of this appetizing
dish. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the aspic?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You cut each squab in halves and put one-half in
a mold and then you pour on the aspic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dorothy, you talk as if you&rsquo;d been doing birds
in aspic all your life. Did you ever cook them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once,&rdquo; dimpled Dorothy. &ldquo;At cooking
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how to make aspic,&rdquo; declared Ethel
Brown proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soak a quarter of an ounce of vegetable gelatine
in a pint of water for two hours; then add the
strained juice of a lemon, pepper and salt and
cayenne, two tablespoonfuls of Tarragon vinegar and
another pint of water. Let it cook for a few minutes
over a slow fire and then boil it for two or
three minutes and strain it through a jelly bag over
your birdies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you can&rsquo;t do that that way,&rdquo; cried Ethel
Blue. &ldquo;Their elbows will show through when
they&rsquo;re turned out of their molds. You have to put
in a layer of jelly and when it is stiffened a little
put in your bird, and then pour the rest of the jelly
over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Correct,&rdquo; approved Dorothy. &ldquo;We must be
sure to have enough for each person to have a half
bird in a mold. They are turned out at the last
minute and a sprig of parsley is laid on top of each
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; came a faint cry from Roger.
&ldquo;I am swooning with joy at the sound of this delicious
food. I&rsquo;m so glad Aunt Louise is giving this
party and not one of the chicken salad ladies of
Rosemont.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aspic is good to know about for hot weather
use,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been meaning all summer
to tell Della how to make it&mdash;she feels the heat
so awfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can put all sorts of meats in it, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And vegetables; peas and beets and carrots
very tender and cut very fine. Tomato jelly makes
a good salad, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could make pretty little individual molds
of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to have for salad after these
birds?&rdquo; inquired Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have alligator pear salad. It&rsquo;s as easy as
fiddle. You just have to pare the alligators and
take out their cores&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a butcher&rsquo;s knife?&rdquo; inquired Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and cut them in halves lengthwise. Then
you put the pieces on a pale yellow-green lettuce
leaf, and pour French dressing over it, and there you
are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it all except the name,&rdquo; objected Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christen it something else, and be happy,&rdquo;
urged Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for sweeties?&rdquo; Roger demanded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going through this feast systematically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go on to the sweeties until we&rsquo;ve settled
on the bread, then,&rdquo; insisted Ethel Brown, &ldquo;I say
Parker House rolls.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Or pocket book rolls&mdash;the same thing, only
smaller,&rdquo; said Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t made any since we were at Chautauqua;
I shall have to look them up again,&rdquo; confessed
Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Ethel Brown. &ldquo;You scald
two cups of milk and then put into it three tablespoonfuls
of butter, two teaspoonfuls of sugar and
a teaspoonful and a half of salt. When it has
cooled off a little add a dissolved yeast cake and
three cups of flour and beat it like everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Command me on the day of the party,&rdquo; offered
Roger politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will,&rdquo; giggled the girls, and they said it so
earnestly that Roger gazed at them suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cover it up and let it rise; then cut it through
and through and knead in two and a half cups more
flour. Let it rise again. Put it on a floured board,
knead it, and roll it out to half an inch in thickness.
Then cut out the rolls with a floured biscuit cutter.
Brush one-half of each roll with melted butter and
fold the round in halves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they slide open?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you pinch the edges together. Arrange
them in your pan and cover them over so they can
rise in comfort. Then bake them in a hot oven for
from twelve to fifteen minutes,&rdquo; ended Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t as easy as Della&rsquo;s lightning biscuits,
but they&rsquo;re so good when they&rsquo;re done that you don&rsquo;t
mind having taken the trouble about them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now for the sweeties,&rdquo; insisted Roger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid you&rsquo;ll forget them and my tooth is as sweet as
ever it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are frozen things absolutely forbidden?&rdquo; inquired
Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, no, let&rsquo;s have one frozen thing. We&rsquo;re going
to have some of the Rosemont people who aren&rsquo;t
relatives, you know, and I hate to think of what
they&rsquo;d say about Aunt Louise if she didn&rsquo;t give them
something frozen!&rdquo; laughed Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have frozen peaches, then. Make them
in the proportion of two quarts of peaches to two
cups of sugar, a quart of water, and the juice of a
lemon and a half. You peel the peaches and take
out the stones and rub the fruit through a colander.
Put the peach pulp and the lemon juice into a syrup
made by boiling the sugar and water together for
five minutes and letting it cool. Pour it all into the
freezer and grind it until it is firm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Command me,&rdquo; murmured Roger again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Roger! You shan&rsquo;t be worked to
death! Patrick will do the grinding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For small mercies I&rsquo;m thankful,&rdquo; returned
Roger, a beaming smile breaking over his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak for chopped preserved ginger with
whipped cream, served in those lovely ramequins of
Aunt Louise&rsquo;s,&rdquo; cried Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we have maple marguerites to go
with everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New to me, but let&rsquo;s have &rsquo;em,&rdquo; urged Roger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boil together a cup and a half of brown sugar
and a half a cup of water until it makes a soft ball
when it&rsquo;s dropped into cold water. Let it cool for a
few minutes and then put in half a teaspoonful of
maple flavoring and beat it all together. Have
ready a quarter of a cup of finely chopped nut meats.
Add half of this amount and drop this perfectly <i>dee</i>-licious
stuff on to crackers. While it&rsquo;s still warm
enough to be sticky sprinkle over the crackers the remainder
of the nut meats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll grind the nut meats,&rdquo; offered Roger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ask for heavy pay in marguerites!&rdquo; laughed
Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I scorn your aspersions of my character,&rdquo; returned
her brother solemnly. &ldquo;What are you going
to have to drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee&mdash;grape-juice&mdash;lemonade&mdash;the usual
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s a pretty good list. Write it down
and let&rsquo;s see what Aunt Louise thinks of it,&rdquo; recommended
Helen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI
<br />COLUMBUS DAY</h2>
<p>Ethel Blue, as Columbus Day approached,
was filled with many strange feelings, some of
them far from pleasant. When she read a letter
from her father a few days before the twelfth she
felt as if dread had brought upon her exactly what
she had dreaded. The letter was filled with loving
expressions but it told her that her father was to be
married very soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that you will love the dear lady who has
honored me by saying that she will relieve my loneliness,&rdquo;
he wrote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> would have relieved his loneliness if he had
given me a chance,&rdquo; Ethel sobbed to herself as she
lay on her bed and read the tear-blotted lines for the
tenth time.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;It will be a sorrow to you to leave Aunt Marion and
your cousins, but perhaps the thought that now you will
belong in a home of your own will make up for it, in part,
at any rate. I don&rsquo;t see how we can all help being happy
together, and we must all try to make each other happy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>Ethel Blue thought of a great many things to say
in reply to her father. They sounded very smart
and very convincing as she said them over to herself
in a whisper, but just as she was wiping her eyes and
getting up to sit at her desk and put them on paper
her Aunt Marion&rsquo;s suggestion that she would be
selfish if she did anything that would hurt her father
or prevent him from making a belated happiness for
himself cut her to the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t love me or he wouldn&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; she
repeated, and then she remembered that all her life
she had had a home and a loving family of cousins
who were as good as brothers and sisters, while her
father had spent the same time without the thought,
even, of home-making.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s some old Fort Myer woman who&rsquo;s
as cross as two sticks,&rdquo; she murmured again and
again; and then an inner voice seemed to speak in her
ear and tell her that there was no reason why she
should not imagine that it was some really lovely
person who was as sweet as she was pretty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody says my mother was pretty,&rdquo; thought
poor Ethel Blue, who had been making herself very
miserable by her old habit of &ldquo;pretending&rdquo; without
any basis of fact, and who now was trying to get a
scrap of comfort from the thought that her father
had had good taste once and might be trusted to exercise
it again.</p>
<p>Whether or not to show the letter to her Aunt
Marion she did not know. Her father had not said
whether he had informed her or not. Usually Ethel
told her aunt everything promptly, but now she did
not feel as if she could speak of the thing that had
appeared dreadful when it was only a possibility.
The reality was so much worse that it did not seem
as if she could trust herself to mention it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Louise has asked him to come on to the
housewarming,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait and see if he
comes. Then he can tell her and Aunt Marion himself;
and if he doesn&rsquo;t come it won&rsquo;t be any worse for
me to tell them a few days from now than right off
this minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so forlorn an Ethel Blue who dragged herself
through the preparations for the Columbus Day
entertainment, that Ethel Brown could not help noticing
the melancholy air that hung over her usually
smiling face. Ethel Blue would make no explanation
to her cousin, nor would she tell her aunt anything
more than the reassuring words that she was
perfectly well. They gave up trying to make her
talk about herself, trusting to time to bring its own
healing.</p>
<p>No letter came from her father announcing his acceptance
of his sister Louise&rsquo;s invitation, nor did another
letter reach Ethel Blue. She was inclined to
make a grievance of this until it occurred to her that
she was not likely to hear until she replied to her
father&rsquo;s announcement of his proposed marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a serious thing and I ought to answer his
letter right off,&rdquo; her conscience told her, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t
say I&rsquo;m glad and I don&rsquo;t want to say I&rsquo;m not glad.
I&rsquo;ll wait until after the twelfth, any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her feelings of selfishness and uncertainty made
her a miserable girl during the interval.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>On the morning of Columbus Day the Mortons
and Hancocks went into New York to the Watkinses.
Della&rsquo;s and Tom&rsquo;s father was a clergyman who
worked among the foreigners of the East Side.
This was an advantage to the Club members when
they watched the procession that wound its way from
the lower part of the city northward to Columbus
Circle at 59th Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These people must come from all over Europe,&rdquo;
exclaimed Ethel Brown as bits of conversation in languages
that she never had heard drifted to her ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New York is called one of the largest foreign
cities in the world,&rdquo; laughed Roger, whose spirits
had risen although he was having difficulties again
with his camera and its persistent desire to take
everything that came within its range, &ldquo;whether the
girls are pretty or not!&rdquo; he complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say that New York is the second largest
German city in the world, and that there are more
Hebrews of different nationalities gathered here than
anywhere else,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are a lot of people wearing peasant costumes
that I never saw in any geography,&rdquo; cried Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When otherwise not accounted for you can generally
put them among the Balkan states,&rdquo; laughed
Della.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that girl over there in peasant costume
and right side of her is a girl in the latest New York
style! That&rsquo;s a tremendous contrast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the American-dressed girl thinks she
is very fashionable, but the other looks much more
sensibly dressed and more attractive, too,&rdquo; said
James gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a great deal prettier girl for one reason,&rdquo;
smiled his sister. &ldquo;She would look better whatever
she wore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all laughed at James who insisted that he
preferred peasant dress, but they all exclaimed with
delight at the gorgeous costumes worn by a group of
Hungarian men. Some of them were riding in carriages
and they seemed very self-conscious but greatly
pleased at the attention they attracted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a great day for the Italians,&rdquo; said Helen
as band after band, and society after society, bearing
the Italian red, white and green passed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Columbus was an Italian. They ought to
feel comfortable about it. He discovered us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all shouted at James&rsquo;s way of putting his defense
of Columbus&rsquo;s countrymen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to hear any of the speeches at
Columbus Circle we&rsquo;d better hop into the subway and
speed to 59th Street,&rdquo; urged Tom.</p>
<p>They were in plenty of time, and watched the
placing around the Columbus monument of numberless
wreaths and emblems which the societies brought
with them, chiefly at the ends of tall poles and deposited
at the feet of the statue of the great explorer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>As soon as they reached home the Mortons all
went over to Sweetbrier Lodge to help with the final
decorations. The attic they had set in order the day
before. This was necessary for they had to have a
curtain and they wanted to put it through a rehearsal
as well as themselves. Extra chairs had been
brought in for the occasion and they were now unfolded
so that the little audience room was ready for
its opening performance.</p>
<p>Below stairs all was ready in the kitchen department,
the Ethels learned when they offered their services
there. What was not completed was the arrangement
of flowers and branches throughout the
rooms. At the end of an hour during which the
Ethels and Dorothy and Helen arranged and Roger
carried, the house looked really lovely.</p>
<p>The color scheme of the lower floor was so
autumnal that it was not hard to follow it out in
leaves and blossoms. Chrysanthemums were ready
to emphasize the yellow tones, and bronze leaves
from oaks and chestnuts carried on the darker hues.
Here and there one of Dorothy&rsquo;s Japanese gardens
gave an air of quaintness to a corner, or stood in relief
against a screen.</p>
<p>Upstairs the nursery was a bower of white cosmos;
Dorothy&rsquo;s room was feathery with pink blossoms of
the same delicate flower; against Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s primrose
walls trailed the yellow leaves of a grapevine;
purple asters nodded in the violet chamber, and the
gray guest room wore fluffs of clematis.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>It was not a large party that gathered at Mrs.
Smith&rsquo;s for the housewarming. The family connection
was not small, however, and the newcomers had
made some warm friends during the year that they
had lived in Rosemont. The older Watkinses and
Hancocks had come, and about fifty people filled the
drawing room comfortably, admiring its beauty as
they waited for the signal to go upstairs to the attic
to see one of the entertainments which Rosemonters
had learned to expect from the United Service Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very charming,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Hancock
to her sister. &ldquo;I see your hand here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very much,&rdquo; demurred Miss Graham. &ldquo;I
merely made an occasional suggestion or told them
how to work out some good idea of their own. The
color scheme is Mrs. Smith&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is charming,&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Hancock, her
eyes moving from the yellow-white wood-work to the
natural pongee walls and then on to the next shade
of yellow, found in the draperies of the windows,
made of a heavy linen dyed to strike the next note in
the color scale. The furniture was upholstered in
three or four shades of brown; a bit of gold flashed
sombrely from the shadows, and an occasional touch
of dull blue brought out the blue tones of the handsome
rugs.</p>
<p>Every one took a peek into the upper rooms as
they passed upstairs to the attic. Ayleesabet&rsquo;s
nursery received much praise, and the delicate tones
of the bed-rooms won immediate approval. In the
attic they found comfortable wicker chairs arranged
about the room facing a small stage before which
hung a tan linen curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the children going to do?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Emerson of his hostess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Smith.
&ldquo;Dorothy said it would be appropriate for Columbus
Day, so I entrusted it all to the young people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the curtain was drawn the Club was disclosed
grouped on the stage. They sang Miss
Bates&rsquo;s &ldquo;America the Beautiful,&rdquo; Mrs. Smith accompanying
them on the piano.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I have to do with the program,&rdquo; she
said to Mr. Emerson when it was over and she had
again taken her seat beside him.</p>
<p>Then Tom told the story of Columbus&mdash;how he
was born at Genoa and became a sailor and when he
was about thirty-four years old went with a brother
to live in Lisbon. Tom was seated on the stage at
a table and two or three of the others sat about as if
they were in a library listening to the talk. They
entered quite naturally into the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four years later,&rdquo; continued Tom, &ldquo;somebody
gave Columbus a map that put the Orient directly
west of Spain, and Columbus became filled with a
desire to search out the East by sailing west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read that he died thinking he had discovered
the East,&rdquo; responded Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He laid his plans before the Portuguese king,
but he found he couldn&rsquo;t trust him, so he went to King
Ferdinand and Queen Isabella in Spain. They summoned
their wisest men to pass on the subject at a
council held at Salamanca. For three years they
kept him waiting about in uncertainty before they reported
to the king that his idea was absurd. Columbus
was furious&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should think he might have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and he started at once for Paris to try to get
the king of France, Charles VIII, to help him. He
took his little son with him and one night they slept
at a monastery. The prior became interested in Columbus&rsquo;s
story and believed in him and didn&rsquo;t want
the glory of his achievement to go to another country.
So he managed to secure for him another interview
with Ferdinand and Isabella, and we&rsquo;re going
to see now,&rdquo; said Tom, turning to the audience,
&ldquo;what happened at the convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that the curtain fell. When it parted once
more a dark curtain across the stage represented the
outside of the convent. Ethel Brown recited Trowbridge&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Columbus at the Convent,&rdquo; while James
acted the part of the Prior; Roger, Columbus; and
Dicky, little Diego.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those children have a real feeling for costume,&rdquo;
whispered Miss Graham to her neighbor, and then
started as she found that it was not her brother-in-law,
Dr. Hancock, as she supposed, but Ethel Blue&rsquo;s
father, Captain Morton, who had come in in the
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; he said, smiling at her startled
air. &ldquo;I suppose they made these things themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys are wearing their sisters&rsquo; long stockings
and the girls made the short, puffy trunks and
short, full coats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel Brown&rsquo;s voice sounded clearly through the
darkness though her hearers could not see her.</p>

<p class="t">The prior came to the gate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the dark curtain was drawn and a room was

</div>
<p>The pantomime followed the lines closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t Dicky cunning!&rdquo; exclaimed Dicky&rsquo;s
adoring grandmother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dicky was a duck!&rdquo; exclaimed Helen, who had
slipped out to see the pantomime. &ldquo;We told him
what he was supposed to be&mdash;a little boy travelling
with his father, and that they had to stop and ask for
food and that a kind man took them in and gave him
a comfy bed. He seemed to understand it all, and
he took hold of James&rsquo;s hand and looked up in his
face as seriously as if he were the real thing. He
was splendid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same I&rsquo;m always relieved when Dicky&rsquo;s
part is over and he hasn&rsquo;t done anything awful!&rdquo;
confessed Dorothy, who had come out also. &ldquo;It
would be just like him to say to James, &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t
give me any bread; I want cookieth!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We tried to impress on him that he wasn&rsquo;t to say
anything&mdash;that nobody but Ethel Brown was to say
anything; that was the game. I dare say if James
had spoken Dicky would have ordered his meal to
suit his fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Tom went on with Columbus&rsquo;s story at this point,
but he spoke from the floor because tableaux were being
arranged behind the curtains. He told how the
interview with the king and queen that the prior had
arranged, all went wrong and how Columbus started
again for France but was called back by the queen
whose imagination had been excited by what he told
her, and who promised to pledge her jewels to raise
money for his expedition.</p>
<p>Here the curtains swung open and showed a brilliant
scene, Della representing the queen, James the
king, and all the other Club members, courtiers.
Columbus was arguing his case before the court and
he was shown in the act of knocking off the end of an
egg to convince the men who had said that they would
believe the world was round when they saw the impossible
happen&mdash;when an egg should stand upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Roger&rsquo;s hand won&rsquo;t slip,&rdquo; murmured
Roger&rsquo;s mother; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a real egg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was while she was standing beside the queen as
one of her ladies in waiting that Ethel Blue&rsquo;s eyes
happened to fall on her father out in the audience.
The light from the stage illuminated his face and she
thought that she never had seen him so happy as he
looked at that moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so dear and he&rsquo;s going away from me,&rdquo; she
groaned inwardly. &ldquo;Now if it were only dear Miss
Daisy he&rsquo;s going to marry,&rdquo; she wished with all her
heart as she noticed that Miss Graham sat in the next
chair; &ldquo;but it isn&rsquo;t; it&rsquo;s some old Fort Myer woman.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>The curtain fell on her misery and Tom again took
up his tale. He told about the three tiny ships that
Columbus managed to secure, and their setting sail
and how frightened the sailors became when day
after day passed and they saw no chance of ever
reaching new land or ever returning home, and how
they threatened to mutiny if he did not turn back.</p>
<p>Then came another pantomime with Roger as
Columbus and James as the mate of the <i>Santa
Maria</i>, while Ethel Brown recited Joaquin Miller&rsquo;s
poem:</p>
<h3>COLUMBUS</h3>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Behind him lay the gray Azores,</p>
<p class="t">Behind the Gates of Hercules;</p>
<p class="t0">Before him not the ghost of shores,</p>
<p class="t">Before him only shoreless seas.</p>
<p class="t0">The good mate said: &lsquo;Now must we pray,</p>
<p class="t">For lo, the very stars are gone.</p>
<p class="t0">Brave Admiral, speak, what shall I say?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;Why, say, &ldquo;Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;&lsquo;My men grow mutinous day by day;</p>
<p class="t">My men grow ghastly wan and weak.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">The stout mate thought of home; a spray</p>
<p class="t">Of salt wave washed his swarthy cheek.</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;What shall I say, brave Admiral, say,</p>
<p class="t">If we sight naught but seas at dawn?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Why, you shall say at break of day,</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;They sailed and sailed, as winds might blow,</p>

<p class="t0">These very winds forget their way,</p>
<p class="t">For God from these dread seas is gone.</p>
<p class="t0">Now speak, brave Admiral, speak and say&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">He said: &lsquo;Sail on! sail on! and on!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;They sailed. They sailed. Then spake the mate:</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;This mad sea shows his teeth to-night.</p>
<p class="t0">He lifts his lip, he lies in wait,</p>
<p class="t">With lifted teeth as if to bite;</p>
<p class="t0">Brave Admiral, say but one good word:</p>
<p class="t">What shall we do when hope is gone?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">The words leapt like a leaping sword:</p>
<p class="t">&lsquo;Sail on! sail on! sail on! and on!&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Then, pale and worn, he kept his deck,</p>
<p class="t">And peered through darkness. Ah, that night</p>
<p class="t0">Of all dark nights! And then a speck&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">A light! a light! a light! a light!</p>
<p class="t0">It grew, a starlit flag unfurled!</p>
<p class="t">It grew to be Time&rsquo;s burst of dawn.</p>
<p class="t0">He gained a world; he gave that world</p>
<p class="t">Its grandest lesson: &lsquo;On! sail on!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The last picture was Columbus gazing joyfully at
the land he had discovered through his perseverance.
It was supposed to be the early morning of October
12, 1492, and Roger, surrounded by his sailors, stood
with a foot on the rail of his boat, shielding his eyes
from the rising sun, while the others crowded behind
him, whispering with delight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>When the curtains fell together for the last time
the lights flashed out upon the audience and disclosed
Captain Morton greeting his sister and sister-in-law
and his nieces and nephews.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my girl?&rdquo; he inquired in his cordial,
hearty voice. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Ethel Blue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some one gave her a friendly push forward so her
father did not notice the reluctance with which she
had been almost creeping toward him. He threw
his arm around her shoulders regardless of possible
damage to the elegancies of her court costume, and
kissed her heartily. The tears shone in her eyes as
she forced herself to meet his searching gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not crying!&rdquo; he whispered in her ear, and she
felt her heart give a real pang as the happiness left
his face and was replaced by his old look of sorrow
and endurance. &ldquo;Not crying!&rdquo; he repeated in her
ear. &ldquo;Why, I thought you loved her! You&rsquo;ve
done nothing but write to me about Miss Daisy all
summer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Miss Daisy? Do you mean&mdash;? Is it
Miss Daisy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is Miss Daisy. Here, come behind
the curtain,&rdquo; and he swept his daughter and his
<i>fianc&eacute;e</i> out of sight of the retiring audience. &ldquo;It is
Daisy Graham who is to be your dear mother, my
little Ethel Blue. Are you satisfied now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Father! O, Miss Daisy!&rdquo; cried Ethel Blue,
sobbing now from relief and joy and clinging to both
of them; &ldquo;I never guessed it! It&rsquo;s too wonderful
to be true!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII
<br />THE PARTING BREAKFAST</h2>
<p>Ethel Blue&rsquo;s change of mind about stepmothers
was so complete that her cousins would
have joked her about it except that her Aunt Marion
advised them to say nothing to her on a subject that
had once been so sore a theme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t recall those painful thoughts,&rdquo; she advised.
&ldquo;Ethel Blue will be happier and certainly
Miss Daisy will be if the present mood continues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you couldn&rsquo;t help loving her when you
knew her,&rdquo; Captain Morton had said to Ethel Blue.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I was willing to postpone the wedding
all summer so that you and she might have a chance
to become really well acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a good way,&rdquo; answered Ethel frankly.
&ldquo;If I had known about it I should have thought
everything Miss Daisy did was done for its effect on
me. I should have been suspicious of her all the
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have come to know a very dear woman in a
natural way and it crowns my happiness that you
should care so much for each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since he had waited so patiently for so many
months Captain Morton begged that the wedding
should take place at once. Mrs. Hancock urged her
sister to have it in Glen Point.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you go to Washington you&rsquo;ll have many acquaintances
there but not any more loving friends
than you&rsquo;ve made here and in Rosemont,&rdquo; she said
cordially. &ldquo;It will give the Doctor and me the
greatest happiness to have you married from our
house, and it will be such a delight to all the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.
if they know that they can all be at the wedding
of their dear &lsquo;Miss Daisy.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be easier for all the Rosemont people&mdash;and
it would be very sweet to go to Richard from
your house,&rdquo; murmured Daisy thoughtfully. &ldquo;I believe
I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be easier to bring Aunt Mary on here than
for all the New Jersey clans to go to Washington,&rdquo;
insisted Mrs. Hancock, referring to the aunt with
whom her sister had lived in Washington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; decided Daisy. &ldquo;Richard&rsquo;s furlough
is almost over so it will have to be very soon,&rdquo; she
continued. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to begin my preparations at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So all the plans were made for a quiet wedding for
just the two families and their intimate friends. It
was to be ten days after the housewarming. The
ceremony was to be in the church at Glen Point, with
Ethel Blue as maid of honor, and Margaret and
Helen, Ethel Brown and Della as the bridesmaids.</p>
<p>Even this very first decision gave the Ethels a
twinge of pain, because it prophesied their coming
separation. Never before had they been separated
at any such function, yet now Ethel Blue was to be in
one position and her twin cousin in another. They
both sighed when it was talked over, and they glanced
at each other a trifle sadly. They did not need to
put the meaning of their glances into words.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>Dr. Hancock was to give the bride away. To
everybody&rsquo;s regret Lieutenant Morton could not be
present to act as his brother&rsquo;s best man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m more sorry than I can tell you, old fellow,&rdquo;
he wrote. &ldquo;Roger will have to take my place and
give you all my good wishes with his own. You may
congratulate me, too, for I&rsquo;ve just got word that my
step has come. I can now sign myself,
<br /><span class="t2">&ldquo;Your affectionate brother,</span>
<br /><span class="t4">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Roger Morton</span>,</span>
<br /><span class="t6">&ldquo;Capt. U.S.N.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="tb">There was great rejoicing in the Morton family
when they learned this news, and telegrams poured
in on them all day long after the announcement was
publicly made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gives one more touch of happiness,&rdquo; smiled
Richard Morton, who went about beaming. He had
to content himself with the companionship of his
daughter, for his betrothed was too busy to give him
much time. Probably this was a good thing, for it
made her father&rsquo;s visit much as it always had been to
Ethel Blue, and did not impress on her too abruptly
the idea of their new relation.</p>
<p>It was at the meeting of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C. held very
soon after the housewarming that the members decided
to give a breakfast in celebration of the wedding
and of Ethel Blue&rsquo;s departure from Rosemont.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call it a breakfast, but we&rsquo;ll have it rather
late,&rdquo; said Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; growled Roger hungrily. &ldquo;I like my
morning nourishment early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be out on our terrace, and it&rsquo;s getting
to be late in the season and if it&rsquo;s too cold we
can&rsquo;t have it there,&rdquo; said Dorothy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put in your glass windows and have it at a
civilized hour,&rdquo; implored Roger.</p>
<p>Dorothy looked at Helen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask Mother if she won&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Then we can have a fire in the open fireplace out
there if it should be really frosty. I forgot we had
all those comforts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must give the Glen Point people time to get
over, if Roger can restrain his appetite a trifle,&rdquo;
urged Ethel Brown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better have Della and Tom stay all night
so they&rsquo;ll be here on time,&rdquo; urged Ethel Blue. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t get over New Haven being near enough for
Tom to go back and forth so easily. I always
thought it was as far off as Boston.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare I almost weep every time I think of
Ethel Blue&rsquo;s leaving the club,&rdquo; sobbed Tom with loud
groans.</p>
<p>Ethel Blue tossed a pillow at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop making fun of me,&rdquo; she said with her pretended
severity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethel Blue was the founder of this club. Don&rsquo;t
forget that,&rdquo; said James gravely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so solemn, people; you&rsquo;ll make me
bawl,&rdquo; and Ethel Blue looked around her wildly, as
Ethel Brown made a dive into her pocket for her
handkerchief, and Della sniffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop your nonsense, children,&rdquo; urged Helen.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make a list of what we are going to do at our
breakfast. First, what shall we eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The discussion waxed absorbing, but when it came
to the arrangement of a program it was found that
there seemed to be fewer ideas than was customary
among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Helen. &ldquo;Usually
we&rsquo;re tumbling over ourselves suggesting things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got an idea, but it&rsquo;s sort of a joke and I
don&rsquo;t want to take the edge off it by telling it now,&rdquo;
admitted James.</p>
<p>It proved that all of them were in the same predicament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you&mdash;let&rsquo;s have Helen and Roger the
committee to arrange this program,&rdquo; suggested Tom.
&ldquo;Then we can each one tell the committee what our
particular idea is, and they&rsquo;ll be the only ones who
will know all the jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They decided that this would be the best way, and
the committee withdrew to a corner where it was
visited by one after the other of the rest of the members,
while the unoccupied people drew around the
piano on which Ethel Blue was playing popular
songs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you go?&rdquo; Tom asked her as she
stopped for a few minutes to hunt up a new piece of
music.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The wedding is the day after our breakfast; then
they go off on a week&rsquo;s trip and when they come back
they&rsquo;ll pick me up here and take me on to Fort Myer
with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means that you&rsquo;ll only be here about ten
days longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel Blue nodded, her eyes filling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d give us your idea now, Tom,&rdquo;
called Helen, seeing from across the room that her
little cousin was not far from tears, and Tom went
away, leaving her to let her fingers slip softly through
a simple tune that her Aunt Marion had taught her
to play in the dusk without her notes. She wondered
if she would ever do it again; if her new mother and
her father would want her to play it to them; if she
should be happy, the only young person in the household
when she had been accustomed to a large family;
if she could ever get along without Dicky to tease her
and to be teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Marion says that every change in life has
its good points and its bad ones,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I
must make the most out of the good points and try
not to notice the bad ones or to change them into
good ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tune rang out with a gayer lilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way, there are so many good points now
that I ought not to think about the others. I&rsquo;ve all
my life wanted to live with Father. Here&rsquo;s my
chance, and I must see only that my wish has come
true.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You sound very gay over here by yourself,&rdquo; said
James&rsquo;s voice behind her. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t sound as if
you were sorry at all about leaving us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to balance things,&rdquo; Ethel Blue answered.
&ldquo;I lose Ethel Brown and all of you, but
I gain Father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be coming north for your holidays next
summer, I suppose. That will be a great old time
for the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.,&rdquo; he said hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be simply too fine for words if the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.
could go to Washington for Washington&rsquo;s Birthday
next winter the way it did this winter,&rdquo; returned
Ethel Blue, beaming at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There certainly is every inducement to get up an
excursion there now,&rdquo; said James. &ldquo;You know
we&rsquo;ve decided on a round robin, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A round robin? How does it work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Helen and Ethel Brown and the Honorary
Member and Dorothy will be here in Rosemont,
Margaret will be in Glen Point, Della in New York,
you at Fort Myer and we boys at Harvard and Yale
and the Boston Tech. Helen is going to start a letter
on the first day of each month. She&rsquo;ll tell us
what she&rsquo;s been doing. Ethel Brown will add on a
bit; so will Dicky and Dorothy. It will go to Margaret.
She&rsquo;ll put in a big batch of Glen Point news
and send it in town to Della. When she has finished
she&rsquo;ll send it on to Tom at New Haven, and in course
of time it will reach Roger and me in Boston and
Cambridge and we&rsquo;ll send it on to you in Washington.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That will be perfectly great!&rdquo; exclaimed Ethel.
&ldquo;You can illustrate it with kodaks, and we&rsquo;ll all
know what every one of us is doing all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Aunt Daisy&rsquo;s idea. She thought we&rsquo;d
all like to keep together in some way even if we
couldn&rsquo;t have our Saturday meetings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she splendid!&rdquo; ejaculated Ethel Blue, and
at that instant she felt that she was far richer than
ever before in her life.</p>
<p>The morning of the breakfast proved to be clear
and not too frost-filled for comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really hardly need the glass,&rdquo; Mrs. Smith
said as she and Dorothy examined the terrace at an
early hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was safer to have it, though,&rdquo; answered Dorothy.
&ldquo;It might have rained and it never would
have done to have the bride take cold. Now we can
have the sashes open and the fire will take off the
chill. It&rsquo;s a great combination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Smith agreed that it was, and went on with
her scrutiny of the table.</p>
<p>When the guests arrived at nine o&rsquo;clock, which was
the very latest moment permitted them by Roger,
they found the sun shining merrily on silver and glass
and china, twinkling as if it were in the secret of the
jokes that Helen and Roger had up their sleeves.
Mr. Emerson had sent over his car for the Hancocks,
for the Doctor&rsquo;s car was too small to convey
the entire family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does my heart good to see Richard so radiant,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Morton to her sister-in-law as Captain
Morton ran down the steps to help his <i>fianc&eacute;e</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the best part of his life is before him,&rdquo;
Mrs. Smith answered softly, a smile on her lips.</p>
<p>The hostess sat at one end of the table and Dorothy
at the other. In the middle of one side was
Helen, the president of the United Service Club, and
in the middle of the other, Ethel Blue, the secretary
and departing member. Mingled with the
other club members were Mr. and Mrs. Emerson,
who had contributed so greatly to the Club&rsquo;s pleasure
during the preceding year, and Dr. and Mrs.
Hancock, relatives of to-morrow&rsquo;s bride. The hour
was too early for Mr. and Mrs. Watkins to come out
from New York, but they telephoned their good
wishes and congratulations while the meal was in
progress.</p>
<p>It was a simple breakfast but everything was good
both to eat and to look at. It began with fruit, of
which there were several kinds, and continued with
a well-cooked cereal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of your five minute cereals for me,&rdquo; smiled
Mrs. Smith. &ldquo;I always have even the short-time
ones cooked at least twice as long as they are reputed
to need. It brings out their flavor better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the cereal with its rich cream came chops
for the meat eaters and individual <i>omelettes souffl&eacute;s</i>,
as light as a feather, for the egg eaters. The coffee
was clear and turned to a warm gold when the cream
worked its magic upon it. Broiled fresh mushrooms
with bacon brought it all to an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the kind of muffins I like best,&rdquo; Ethel Brown
said in a undertone to Dorothy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Potatoes from our own farm,&rdquo; announced the
hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All praise to Dorothy, the farmer,&rdquo; hailed Mr.
Emerson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly to Roger,&rdquo; protested Dorothy. &ldquo;He
managed the vegetable end of our planting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Helen tapped on her glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be the last meeting of all the members
of the U.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;C.,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;because Ethel Blue and
the boys are going away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A shade fell over the faces of all those around the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We who are left at home here are going to keep
it up, so that there&rsquo;ll always be a Club for the wanderers
to come back to. And we&rsquo;re going to have a
round robin fly about every month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;ll all get together next summer in
the holidays,&rdquo; suggested Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try to,&rdquo; the president continued. &ldquo;Now I
want to ask you to drink in Aunt Louise&rsquo;s nice brown
coffee to the health of the founder of the United
Service Club. She is its secretary and to-day she is
distinguished as being about to leave us for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rapped the table and shouted Ethel Blue&rsquo;s
name joyously. She sat with her head bowed, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speech, speech,&rdquo; cried Mr. Emerson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo; replied Ethel Blue
breathlessly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;ve had the Club. It
has been fun, although we&rsquo;ve had to work pretty hard
at it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made fun for others,&rdquo; said Mrs. Emerson.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve lived up to your name:&mdash;the United
Service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to propose the health of the Club as a
whole,&rdquo; said Mrs. Morton. &ldquo;As a citizen of Rosemont
I can repeat what has been said to me by other
citizens, even if, as the mother of some of the members,
I might be somewhat embarrassed to utter such
praise. Rosemont thinks that the United Service
Club has done more to stir up the town than any other
organization it has ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was general applause from the grown-ups.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear some of these undertakings,&rdquo;
said Captain Morton. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t some one recite
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, Father, I wrote you all about them when each
one came off,&rdquo; objected Ethel Blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Richard will hear what some of them are
when we give out our prizes,&rdquo; said Helen. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
decided to give prizes for certain especial successes.
Ethel Brown, for instance, will be so good as to rise
and receive a reward for reciting more poems than
we ever knew could be learned by one small brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ethel Brown rose and received, while the rest applauded,
a small sieve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why a sieve?&rdquo; inquired Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sieve is symbolic. Ethel takes in verse
through her eyes and lets it out through her lips just
like a sieve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the laughter subsided, Helen continued:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our next prize is for Grandfather Emerson, who
supplied Ethel Brown with much of the material with
which she has favored us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Emerson was decorated with a miniature well
and pump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose this is the fount of English undefiled
on which I drew,&rdquo; he commented.</p>
<p>The president went on with her distribution. The
jokes were all mild but for the Club members each
had its meaning. James received a small pair of
crutches, because he was the only one who had broken
a leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it wasn&rsquo;t scissors,&rdquo; said his father.
&ldquo;He might be led into cutting corners again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorothy received a pink tin containing a cake with
pink icing&mdash;all by way of recognition of her love
of cooking and of pink. Roger&rsquo;s gift was a set of
collar and cuffs made from paper &ldquo;dirt bands&rdquo; and
adorned with cuff buttons and a cravat of dazzling
beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man of fashion and a farmer combined,&rdquo;
Helen announced.</p>
<p>Dicky received a watering can, by way of indicating
his fondness for getting into trouble with water.
A fan went to Della &ldquo;for next summer&rsquo;s use.&rdquo; Tom
had a little Roman soldier as a reminder of his representation
of one of the Great Twin Brethren. Margaret&rsquo;s
offering was a tiny Christmas Ship containing
needles and a spool of thread. Helen gave herself
a doll&rsquo;s coat like the one which she and Margaret
had copied in great numbers for the war orphans.
Ethel Blue&rsquo;s gift was a real present&mdash;a travelling
case fitted with the necessaries of a journey. This
came from all the members of the Club.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just too dear,&rdquo; whispered Ethel Blue,
too overcome to speak.</p>
<p>They drowned her voice in a burst of chatter, so
that she might not burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a few gifts left,&rdquo; said Helen, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;d
like to give them out by acclamation. Whose tires
have we worn until they were almost worn out and
yet <i>she</i> has never tired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandmother Emerson,&rdquo; came the ringing answer,
and Helen ran around to her grandmother&rsquo;s
chair and gave her a toy automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who made the most box furniture for Rose
House?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger,&rdquo; shouted James at the top of his lungs,
while at the same moment Roger cried &ldquo;James.&rdquo;
The others, having been instructed to keep silent,
concluded that the question was settled for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roger <i>and</i> James,&rdquo; decreed Helen, presenting
each of them with a knife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are our high-flyers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ethels,&rdquo; every one said promptly, for the
Ethels were the only ones present who had been up
in an aeroplane.</p>
<p>A tiny flyer was given to each of them.</p>
<p>So it went on until the supply of parcels in Helen&rsquo;s
basket was exhausted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, to wind up with,&rdquo; Helen said, &ldquo;I want to
thank Uncle Richard for giving us the very finest
kind of present,&rdquo; and she waved her hand across the
table to Miss Daisy, whose shining eyes and glowing
cheeks told of her delight in all she had seen.
&ldquo;Uncle Richard is taking away Ethel Blue, but he&rsquo;s
giving us an aunt. We love her already and we think
we&rsquo;ve all won a prize in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Daisy, slipping one
hand into Ethel Blue&rsquo;s and laying the other on Captain
Morton&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;It is I who have won a
prize&mdash;a double prize!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

opportunities to fix the problem.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689

An alternative method of locating eBooks:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/GUTINDEX.ALL</a>
